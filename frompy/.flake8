# Some PEP8 deviations are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#       E301 expected 1 blank line
#       E302 expected 2 blank lines
#       E305 expected 2 blank lines
#       E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)
#       E741 ambiguous variable name
#       F401 imported but unused
#       F403 import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#       F405 defined from star imports
#       F811 redefinition (should be fixed in pyflakes 2.1.2)
#       F822 undefined name in __all__

# Nice-to-haves ignored for now
#       E501 line too long
