<p>
  The motivation behind our effort is our unconditional love for our children.

<h2>Quantapix, Inc.</h2>
<p>
  Quantapix, the software startup, was born as a precursor to the vicious, cruel
  and simply unimaginable, yet intuitively well-understood power struggle
  between the "elite" and the rest of us.
</p>
<p>
  As trained, skilled and seasoned software engineers, we seized on the "deja
  vu" opportunity to systematically correct a deep social injustice ingrained in
  our Family Courts targeting and abusing our children.
</p>
<h2>Weaponized Psychology</h2>
<p>
  Just as documented, advanced "weaponized psychology" has been used extensively
  by some "trusted" professionals of our most respected institutions.
</p>
<p>
  These elite predators knowingly hurt and tortured our children, while holding
  us ideological hostages for perhaps millions of dollars. We believe, and with
  we attempt to publicly prove, that AI, or the more humble "deep learning"
  technology, is not all evil nor needs to be exclusively exploitative.
</p>
<h2>"The Enemy Is Within"</h2>
<p>
  Despite the naive, uninformed and irrational fears of the inexperienced, "the
  enemy is within" in all tyrannies (e.g. fascism, communism, etc.) in the form
  of yet uncommunicated contradictions and intrinsic inconsistencies. Our dream,
  along with our concrete, informed steps we continue to take to approach it, is
  to devise AI software to actively protect our American-born children from
  greedy professional torturing and forceful, institutionalized separation and
  isolation.
</p>
<p>
  Family Court-mandated, and even directly ordered, parental alienation, while
  paying astronomical profits to the "trusted" elite, is nothing but ruthless
  and cruel child abuse. Seeking out contradictions and inconsistencies in "vast
  oceans" of deceitful data with ever-adapting, fluidly learning, yet still
  reproducible software mechanisms is exactly what AI, "the child protector"
  kind, was inherently invented for. It can rightfully become our openly shared
  ethical and moral reference, an always true, falsifiable and verifiably
  correctable guiding compass.
