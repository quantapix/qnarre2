# Modeling Ideological Judicial Activism

{@a top}

We have outlined our overall objective. In this group of blogs, we set out to introduce the conceptual framework for our efforts.

We present a high-level, yet still easily simulatable view of our problem domain. We also define key abstractions to provide an unambiguous foundation for our subsequent work. And we clarify mechanisms to numerically analyze, or just to simply measure, progress and results in a reproducible fashion. In the end, we also draw conclusions and offer usable "packaged" solutions.
