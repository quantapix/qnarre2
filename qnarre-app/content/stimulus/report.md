# "Based On A True Story": A Sample Qnarre Report

## To Atty. Xavier

Due to the quick-fire motions just before the last hearing, I was not able to send out the Beta Draft 0.1 report. I am attaching it now as an Excel file and a [summary .pdf](generated/images/stimulus/report.pdf). I can also send a plain .csv file if necessary.

The Excel workbook is simple, it has a “Raw” table and a “Pivot” summary: the already emailed topics and narratives are the main categories along with the 5 types of judgments that Qnarre will be initially released with. This initial report only draws from the 3 prior judgments of the Court. As such it is an all important skeleton (obviously, no numeric weights) with an **initial 1,277 “inconsistencies”** (the Dr. Deutsch 900+ GAL errors are NOT included).
