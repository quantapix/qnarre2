# Response To Parallel Complaints

{@a top}

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated **Father’s Affidavit** states as follows:

1. Father has now been served with parallel complaints for contempt. The Court has also handed down a judgment on June 13 and a seemingly conflicting order on August 20, 2019.

1. Father filed a Notice of Appeal for the above judgment on June 25, 2019. He also filed three repeated emergency requests for a stay, the latest on October 4, 2019. The Court finally scheduled a hearing for November 4, 2019, apparently regarding Father’s stay request.

1. Father seeks relief/reversal on the grounds of documented subornation of perjury, fraud, deception, misrepresentation, extortion, withholding of evidence, obstruction of justice, mistake, neglect, or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgments.

1. Father was served with the latest amended complaint for contempt, based entirely on the appealed judgment, on October 11, 2019, days after he had filed his third request for a stay.

## Significant Material Changes

1. Since August 5, 7, and 20, 2019, hearings significant material changes have occurred.

1. On June 6, 2019, this Court, under fraudulent circumstances, bullied Father, a software engineer with two advanced degrees, 30+ years of experience, and a proven track record, into immediately accepting a minimum wage “job” by threatening and then handcuffing him.

1. The “job,” a limited 1099 software contract, expired four weeks ago, and, while Father had immediately started equally supporting his four children by mailing simultaneous $104 / week to Mother-B and the MA DOR (Mother-C), respectively, that **support has now ended**.

## Denied Right To Work

1. Father has been without any assets, funds, savings, or credit since he first contacted this Court (J. Donnelly) on June 30, 2017, and he still has no shelter, no car, no phone, etc. With the Court’s knowledge, even his “any and all licenses” have been suspended by the DOR.

1. As finding work and supporting his children is now knowingly and deliberately rendered physically impossible for Father, he is hereby attaching his **Father’s Response Regarding Denied Right To Work** as his first reply to the parallel complaints for contempt.

## Conflicting Parallel Cases

1. Blatantly pretending that the parallel case did not exist, this Court threatened Father with a jail sentence once again on August 5, 2019, if he continued to pay Mother-B only the $104 / week support, that he directly derived from the Official Guidelines, and not the ordered $233.

1. On August 20, 2019, the probation officer advised this Court that following this same Court’s order of paying Mother-B, the millionaire “rich mother”, $233 / week would set the support for Mother-C, the “poor mother” with a ~$7K declared savings, to a mere $37 / week / child.

1. As the Court’s latest order “requires evidence” to solve the now numerically impossible $342 prior support for Mother-C, the conflict and impasse caused by the Court’s continued blatant disregard of the “parallel case” is unsustainable. The recent 13 idle hearings are the evidence.

1. To resolve the numerically impossible conflict, and deliberate confusion, that the Court has knowingly allowed festering, Father is hereby attaching his **Father’s Response To Merge Conflicting Parallel Cases** as his second reply to the complaints for contempt.

## Sustained Fraud-On-The-Court

1. Both cases originated with Mother-B fraudulently initiating the divorce in 2007. She wanted “freedom” from her then 3.5 yo twins and from having to spend any of her millions on them. While Father had full custody for the following 4 years, Mother-B never contributed a penny.

1. Father moved on from the divorce. The “rich” Mother-B’s vicious jealousy and unchecked irrational fears of poverty - she had grown up on food stamps - turned her into the ideal “victim” for her lawyers. In 2011, they knowingly and cruelly assisted her to lie to the Police, DCF, teachers, doctors, etc. and the Court, just as J. Donnelly noted: “rotten from the head.”

1. Mother-B’s principal fear was the known fact behind child support calculations: “one needs to be first to avoid leftovers.” Starting in 2011, she unsuccessfully pestered this Court for support every four months. Only in 2014, 3 years later, did she receive her “leftover” support.

1. Just as Father asked this Court simultaneously from the start, Mother-C immediately received her support of $342 in 2011, a full 3 years before Mother-B was awarded any support at all.

1. Such clear, unambiguous and documented precedent, regarding the order of awarded child supports, set through extensive, years-long litigation in this same Court, is now proof of the Court’s corrupt tolerance of, and even collusion with, the “trusted” lawyers’ sustained fraud.

1. This Court has knowingly and forcefully falsified its own set prior precedent only to cover for affording its “trusted” professionals free reign in committing deceit, fraud, extortion, deep character assassination, and the cruelest and malicious child abuse, torture and exploitation.

1. Since December 17, 2018, Father has repeatedly filed pleadings to discipline and sanction the blatantly lying, falsifying, and defrauding lawyers. Openly bullied by these “million-dollar” white male attorneys, the Court has been visibly manipulated. Father is re-attaching his **Father's Response To Investigate Sustained Fraud-On-The-Court** as a third reply.

## Personal, Harm And Damages

1. Since January 19, 2018, Father has filed many pleadings with the specific, identical scope of documenting the injury, harm and damages of the now **$7,084,151** that he/his families had to endure due to unchecked deceit, fraud, extortion, abuse, etc. by this Court’s professionals.

1. On August 20, 2019, this Court claimed that “Plaintiff has not demonstrated... injury, harm, or damage”. As all of Father’s correctly submitted prior motions have been immediately denied, apparently due to his Pro Se status, since the Court neglected even to read the titles, Father consequentially interprets the Court’s latest claim regarding damages as a request.

1. This Court issued a judgment on June 13, 2019, rewarding the attorneys with “damages” of $10,000+. While Father has immediately filed an appeal, that is on track to be “transferred” to the Appeals Court, the seemingly acceptably used pattern for claiming significant damages based on “valuation” of skilled professionals’ duly spent time on the matters is not in doubt.

1. Building on the already confirmed “working” pattern accepted by this Court, Father is attaching **Father’s Response For Relief From Endured Personal Injuries, Emotional Harm And Material Damages** as his fourth reply to the parallel complaints.

1. In it, Father is meticulously documenting current, realized, and significant material damages of **~$420,000** that he has endured due to the unchecked deceit, forced fraud, extortion, abuse (including child abuse), etc. by this Court’s “trusted” professionals since December 17, 2018.

## Institutionalized Child Abuse

1. The cases center around Father’s documented accusations of “sustained, systematic, and institutionalized child abuse”, that this Court’s “trusted” professionals have cruelly leveraged by provoking parents of tortured children into endlessly profitable “high-conflict” litigation.

1. After the June 6, 2019, trial, this Court further harmed the already deeply abused children when it forbid Father from contacting his children in any way. This bullying Court forcefully separated, isolated, and further alienated the children, despite a loving father’s desperate efforts to inform about blatantly tolerated ongoing ruthless fraud and deception in this Court.

1. Father is attaching **Father’s Response To Stop Sustained, Systematic And Institutionalized Child Abuse (Parental Alienation)** as a fifth reply to the complaints.

## Predatory “Mental Health” Madness

1. This Court has been forcefully isolating Father’s children from him based on maliciously false “mental health” claims. Accordingly, his extensive refuting documentation has been systematically rejected, and his therapists and expert witnesses have been repeatedly ignored.

1. His Harvard psychiatry professor therapists have been providing ongoing, critical support for him in his defense from the massive and institutionalized invalidation of his life and reality.

1. Despite the Court’s explicit and fraud-based reference to viciously false “mental health” concerns in its judgments, this Court nevertheless denied once again Father’s request for his highly-qualified and skilled therapists to be his witnesses in the upcoming December 9 trial.

1. Father is attaching his **Father’s Response To Stop Fraudulent And Predatory “Mental Health” Madness** as his sixth reply to the current parallel complaints.

## “Whistle-blower Silencing” Order

1. Bullied by unchecked, lying attorneys, this Court’s to be First Justice (J. Monks) knowingly and blatantly ignored this Court’s established prior precedent regarding the order of supports and unilaterally increased the “rich” mother’s support from $233 to $255 in a flawed order.

1. The next judge attempted to undo the now First Justice’s fraud-based order silently, and without any justification she reduced the support back to $233 from $255 in the June 13, 2019, judgment. The “guilty of contempt” ruling, nevertheless damaged the “poor mother’s” chances for any child support relief, despite her timely request for MA DOR’s assistance.

1. After the February 20, 2019, fraud-based order, the First Justices were suddenly swapped. As a seeming cover-up, the follow-up judges immediately prohibited Father from filing any more motions, without permission. Expectedly, Father’s subsequent requests for permission to file have been ignored, despite pressing concerns regarding the well-being of the children.

1. Father’s only “whistle-blower’s” remedy to protect his families from this corrupt Court has been to write open letters to public officials and the First Justice, as the administrator of the Court. The First Justice’s secretary recently communicated to Father that his letters, even to the administrator of this Court, have been ignored as he must file the “prohibited” motions.

1. Father is attaching **Father’s Response For Relief From The “Whistle-blower Silencing” Order And To Submit All Open Letters As Evidence** as his seventh reply.

## Second Proposed Resolution

1. During the June 6, 2019, trial, this Court requested Father’s routine “finding of facts and proposed judgment” statement. Father filed his document correctly and in time. As the Court has ignored even to mention the existence of Father’s document, Father is now re-attaching his **Father’s Simultaneous Findings Of Fact And Proposed Judgments** as a reference.

1. To resolve the conflicts, Father has been proposing mutually advantageous resolutions from the beginning. He started this second phase of the lawsuits by emailing possible solutions to the Mothers. Father has also filed this year’s first proposal with the Court. He then re-filed it with the simultaneously submitted pre-trial memorandums. Father is hereby attaching his **Second Proposed Resolution By A Loving, Caring And Concerned Father**.

## Call To Sanction Attorneys

1. To protect his children from the corrupted Court, Father submitted a complaint with the Office of Bar Counsel on June 16, 2019. The BBO responded with them needing the cooperation of the Court while considering any complaints. Father’s attached **Father’s Response To Sanction Attorneys** is his attempt to comply with the conditions set by the BBO. His second complaint to the BBO is dated October 20, 2019.

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to consider and rule on his above referenced, duly submitted and herein fully incorporated 8 motions.

Respectfully resubmitted,
