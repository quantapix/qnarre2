# Divorce Law Rigged to Torture Children

{@a top}

Dear Chief Justice,

With this open letter I would like to request your much appreciated assistance in my and my families’ intractable situation. After a combined total of now 54 hearings/events, 9 trial days, 8 depositions and 3 GAL investigations in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court in Cambridge, we have reached a critical point where the Court seemingly has lost interest in protecting the children in the parallel cases.

I followed the Court’s rules and procedures when I filed 3 motions for a February 12, 2018 hearing. I did that after a 3 year cool-off period, specifically in order to legally protect the mothers of my children from all the questionable activities they had been seemingly forced into performing in Court. My filing of the motions came after an explicit letter to the Court (attached) about the circumstances of our cases.

Just 3 weeks ago I found out that one of the motions was denied immediately after the hearing. Had I been notified by the Court, as expected and previously always done, I would have appealed the ruling in a timely fashion. The 3 motions heard in February were existentially critical for my children and myself.

Recently I also learned that the judges were suddenly swapped out. As the children’s school year ended, I scheduled a follow-up hearing for August 6, 2018 regardless. I refiled the initial 3 motions along with an additional 4 requesting the Court to specifically investigate systematic, sustained and institutionalized child abuse. The clerk was initially uncomfortable filing the motions and a supervisor was called upon to check and approve them. I spent considerable effort preparing for the existentially critical Court hearing.

On August 6, the clerk informed me during the pre-hearing check in that my “only” motion heard in February had been denied and I had no basis nor case to have a hearing with the new judge. I was not prepared to dispute the Court’s sudden administrative irregularities regarding the list of filed motions.

I thus desperately turned to mother’s attorney, Gail Otis, for her verbal confirmation to the clerk of the mere existence of the other 2 motions. She had personally received the original 3 motions as she signed and filed a heard response motion to oppose them, clearly itemizing and listing the 3 motions by title. The attorney was also personally a recipient of one of the 28 mailed notices and certificates of service.

Otis without hesitation contradicted her own written records and flatly backed the clerk by stating that only one motion was filed and heard in February. The clerk then summarily “ruled” and dismissed my filed motions telling me to go home and start a new case, with another new judge, by filing a complaint.

Specifically, I would like to ask you to please consider my attached “Defendant’s Renewed Motion For Relief From Judgments” emailed to the Court on August 7. I would like to have the motion scheduled and heard by the Court, somehow, somewhere, without closing the cases and burying the GAL reports.

Starting new cases by filing complaints now would only obfuscate, deceive and obstruct from the extensively documented shenanigans by the attorneys and GALs and would needlessly further extend the emotional suffering and staggering losses of the families, specifically the 4 children. None of the children received any child support from their father this year and new cases would only create even more confusion and legal “churn”.

Sincerely,

## Built-in protection from the rule of law

Dear First Justice

With this open letter I would like to once again request your much appreciated assistance in my and my families’ intractable situation. For context please consider the attached and recently authored open letters to various public officials along with my first letter to you dated June 30, 2017.

This letter is sent due to the significant material change that occurred since my August 13, 2018 letter to Chief Justice Hon. John D. Casey. A hearing was held on August 24, 2018 in the Middlesex Probate and Family Court in Cambridge. All my filed motions mentioned in my August 13th letter were duly heard by Hon. Judge Black, a truly outstanding judge who not just tirelessly confirms every critical junction of her understanding but who also clearly and concisely narrates the consequential steps she thus takes.

Judge Black, who so far had not ruled in the outrageously and abusively churned cases, immediately denied the existentially critical —despite containing only one purposely generic paragraph— “Relief From Judgments” motion. With her narrowly focused questions, the Judge also confirmed that her denial of the motion was exclusively based not on merit but merely on timing: “too late for Rule 60”.

She also parked the rest of the motions as “ill-form(ulat)ed”, waiting for a “base”. Just as I wrote in my attached email, and in order to protect “that” mother of my children, I am content to leave the motions hanging in “that” case until there is movement with the identically same motions in “this” case.

Now that I finally have a cleanly and entirely mechanically (irrespective of merit) “denied” ruling by an obviously impartial and truly outstanding family judge in the cases, I believe the framework has been primed to claim that **divorce law is rigged to torture children**, as perhaps authored by the monstrous “Father of Mass. Divorce Law”, and a “feminist for profit” psychopath, [Atty. Monroe Inker](generated/images/story/inker.pdf).

My layman’s logic, in a nutshell and backed by the attached sampling of my evidence, is as follows:

- Mentally ill, child-abusive psychologist-only GALs cannot be questioned, verified nor eliminated
- It is impossible to question an incumbent (i.e. with 400 cases) GAL without the Court losing face
- It is impossible to defend from a sick, child-abusive and agenda-driven psychologist’s “crazy” label
- Due to immunity, once an activist GAL invalidates, she will stubbornly continue to do so to “resist”
- Mentally ill attorneys seize on the Court’s naive, single-sourced, psychologist-GAL-driven “expertise”
- The Court is ill-equipped, unwilling to police attorneys, perhaps our most intelligent child predators
- The adversarial nature of divorce law (either mother or father, but not both), deeply and lucratively exploited by psychopath attorneys, existentially penalizes well-off parents who love their children
- It is impossible to prove, or even to report, a psychopath attorney’s bullying, child-abusive and perhaps criminal Court activity without seriously implicating a child’s other parent
- A child predator divorce attorney’s shield from “justice” is to keep stirring up intractable conflicts
- Statutes of limitations serve to “forgive”, to reduce this conflict. A loving parent’s only remedy from crimes forced onto the other parent by psychopath attorneys is to let the statutes of limitations expire
- Statutes of limitations apply to crimes committed while fabricating lucrative conflicts by child abusers, but are ill-defined or void when it comes to the endlessly torturing “made-up” conflicts themselves
- The only remedy thus from a maliciously fabricated, “fraud on the Court” conflict —also embedded in a judgement and clearly still torturing affected children— is a “relief from judgement” Rule 60 motion
- Yet, Rule 60 mechanically expires and is automatically denied in one year when statutes of limitations expire in 3 years: **a clearly rigged system written and used by child abusing psychopath attorneys for their own astronomical profits and built-in protection from the rule of law**.

Specifically, I would like to ask you to please consider allowing my re-filing of the hereby attached motions, upcoming affidavit and extensive exhibits in your Probate and Family Court in Cambridge. I request my motions to be refiled/rescheduled for a hearing due to recent, explicit and witnessed “fraud on the Court” by Atty. Gail Otis, specifically on August 6, 2018. The hearing scheduled for that day was canceled directly due to the attorney knowingly, personally and materially lying in Court to the clerk.

My objective with a new hearing is either 1) a Court ruling based on merit or 2) a clean and clear mechanical denial based on timing of Rule 60. Any explicit, written ruling by the Court, in addition to my published, self-authored, and First-Amendment-protected book would serve me in clearing my fatherly name and honor and in reestablishing my professional credibility and perception of sanity; all in order to solve my current existential crisis and to restart my much needed support for all of my children.

Sincerely,

## Dear Governor

Thank you for your August 10, 2018 response to my open letter. Your attention to my and my families’ intractable situation is much appreciated. I am also cognizant that a state governor cannot get involved with the private legal matters of citizens. I sincerely apologize for giving such unintended impression.

As significant material changes have occurred since my first letter to you, I am attaching my current open letters to 2 First Justices and 3 Chief Justices of our beloved Commonwealth. My intention is to assure that proper channels are used to hopefully solve delicate, complex and perhaps even seemingly intractable problems. I fully believe in our Court system and I am confident that it all will get sorted out.

Strictly legal issues and technicalities aside, I am hoping to attract attention to how our innocent children are used, and more specifically psychologically leveraged, by our state-licensed, and seemingly agenda-driven “activist” professionals. While my background is merely technical, I grew up in a communist tyranny as a hated minority. A keen sense of the existential duality of “good and bad” is its side effect.

“Elite” professionals skilled and trained in understanding human behavior (mere “psychologists”, not medical doctors) teach us to protect ourselves from being naive, from “believing in the goodness of all people”. And if we do just that, i.e. we do not trust their “goodness”, the same professionals label us for profit, segregate us and even **forcefully separate our children from us** (see my extensive attachments).

Testament to these unchecked professionals’ (not even a “do no harm” simple oath is requested of them) potential for absolute power, domination and ruthless abuse is the well established fact that only trusted insiders (e.g. secret police or communist party members) were allowed to be so trained in the known paragons of humanity’s most sophisticated psychological warfare, the former Soviet Block dictatorships.

The acute problem of “Russian (psychological) interference” in our lives cannot be exaggerated with the daily, almost psychosis-like symptoms in our media. I still feel somewhat desensitized by the “Russians are coming” shouting, I grew up with it and the Russians did not ever come. Their psychological warfare worked as a charm nevertheless: hundreds of thousands of people left their wealth, belongings behind.

I am not trained to continue with that thread, so I refocus on what I know. A Harvard trained attorney, Monroe Inker, “the Father of Mass. Divorce Law”, personally explained to me his simple recipe for a “win-win” strategy: **ruthlessly leverage the children to force the father to attack the mother in front of the judge**. And he quickly collected all the “wealth left behind”. No wonder he became the emotional “ladies’ man” of the influential divorces in our state. And obviously, a dedicated “feminist for profit”.

As a loving, dedicated father, and past software entrepreneur, I suddenly found myself in the peculiar situation of being forced into complex dual, and parallel lawsuits driven by greed and extreme jealousy. Taking the bad with the good, the simultaneous lawsuits also allowed me to protect myself from the certain and routine “predatory feminist” traps facing all fathers going through any divorces around here.

In my field of software engineering “we can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection”. Obviously that applies to the legal profession as well. And attracting some of the most intelligent “predatory feminist” lawyers, our cases boiled down to “make him attack either mother”.

Lawyers are still bound by the rules of the Court. To conveniently side-step that, “predatory feminists” in family courts skillfully weaponize emotions, “feelings”, and the “science” for all that: psychology. A financially squeezed, stereotypical and loving American father, without the “Russians are coming” childhood experience, would have been easily trapped by either 1) mother “lacks affect” for her children or b) other mother is so evil that falling for her means “naively believing in the goodness of all people”.

In other words, intimidated by the "Harvard Psychology Professor” and the “400 times Mass. GAL superstar of the Family Court’s” status, any routine “psychology fearing” father would have been quickly “reformed” during the Court mandated “therapy until triggering events” (i.e. “he must settle”, “he must accept his faults”, “he needs to reflect”, “he still believes in the goodness of all people”, etc.).

Obviously, any rationally responsible (against the “lack of affect”) or emotionally rejecting (against the other “evil mother”) response in front of judges would have been proof of “he is attacking his children’s mothers” and would have sealed the sought-after “possible personality disorder” rumor. And a loving father forever would have become the “toxic masculine” slave-laborer providing for the lucky feminist lawyers’ “pension plans” (as the other lawyers often referred to the obnoxiously churned lawsuits).

To summarize, the children could not have been so deeply tortured for so many years and the lawsuits would not have been possible without the weaponized psychology component so ruthlessly provided by Dr. Robin Deutsch and co., the Court appointed GALs. And such a cruel and malicious “elite” child predator would never have such systematic and intimidating presence in our state without a state license.

It seems to me that investigating the doctor’s license to practice psychology, and apparently cruelly prey on innocent children and their parents, is the least the Commonwealth can do to protect our children.

Sincerely,

## Activist Family Court victimizing children - a report

Dear Chief Justices,

With this now third open letter I would like to once again request your much appreciated assistance in my and my families’ intractable situation. Much has changed since I last wrote, as we now have the required open court cases and yet another hearing is imminent in the Cambridge Family Court.

At the same time, the essentials of the professionally fabricated, multi-million dollar “high-conflict” setup are the same: 4 children have stayed completely isolated from their loving Dad for yet another year. Even the intentionally meaningless, symbolic only communication link cynically mandated by a court order, compelling children to continually call Dad just to tell him “don’t want to talk”, has ended.

With the risk of repeating myself, I would like to recap some of the stats of the two parallel cases that started simultaneously 7+ years ago in the Cambridge Family Court. There are now a combined 26 eager lawyers “tapped”, with 58 hearings/events, 9 trial days, 9 depositions, an ever growing ~6.7M in family losses, etc. And restoring an income generating capacity for the families is not in sight nor is a priority.

Child support for 4 children has not been paid in more than a year and the factual “in-contempt” amount is fast approaching $100,000 (see the attached motions scheduled to be heard tomorrow).

There are unique characteristics of the dual lawsuits that certainly exercise, and clearly probe and test, the Family Court’s established routines and practices, especially regarding the services of “trusted”, but psychologist-only, GALs. The cases are highly symmetrical yet also extremely polarized and contrasted.

For starters, the original plaintiffs were the two viciously jealous mothers with a 14 year age difference (and a 6 month gap in their relationship with the father of their children): one had no education but was a flaunting multi-millionaire, the other self-schooled, frugal and ambitious but living on government aid.

The 4 children are just as symmetrical and still diametrically opposed: 2 children on each side, repeated one girl and one boy, were the victims. Both boys were systematically abused and tortured by the proud feminist professionals/GALs during the lawsuits. The girls were seemingly used as “controls” as they projected perfection and healthy “sanity.”

One set of children, IVF/gestational carrier twins with no biological link to their ONLY mother, had serious, long-lasting medical issues (ignored by the Court) and they were abandoned by their mother when 3.5 years old (ignored by the Court once again in order to support its “high conflict” GAL).

The other set of children, expectedly healthy and both “conceived out of love”, as pronounced by their mother, were openly condemned by the Court to poverty as the trusted GAL conveniently, per a “higher” feminist script, accused their mother with child abuse with no corroboration, no verification whatsoever.

The symmetries continue: there were two parallel GAL investigations: the elite, “high-conflict” one by Harvard’s Dr. Deutsch (skillfully pulling in 6 more professionals from her “feeder network”) and the “work it out already” by a random Dr. Somers. Expectedly, the Court ordered Dr. Deutsch to be shared. And when 900+ questions were filed, the Court doubled down and ordered Dr. Deutsch back once again.

I am a mathematician, with no skills in law, medicine, psychology, etc. whatsoever. But just as science successfully applies completely generic tools to confidently predict field-specific outcomes, I also set out to, perhaps profitably, characterize the many hundreds of legal documents on my computers. The most fundamental tool in math, science and the newly emerging, and already dominating AI is to look at differences, specifically the variance in differences. This age old approach is still revolutionizing today.

In this sense, I don’t need to know law to successfully quantify, to reason and to train computers with the differences between two sentences in two separate judgements. Moreover, I am in a most unique, and also sadly tragic, situation of having not just all those above symmetries, i.e. scientific “controls”, but also two parallel lawsuits about the same events with two vastly different judgments to compare from the same Court. And just to baseline my own sanity, 3 Harvard psychiatry professors have spent a combined 400 billed hours with me, without the Court ever allowing any of their expertise to be heard.

As my existential, plain survival needs are forcing me to act, specifically to **defend my right to work**, I would like to ask the question: can the Court self-reflect? Can the Family Court accept a quantitative, flexible report of hundreds of its obvious, common-sense inconsistencies, systematically grouped into topical, ideological narratives and automatically collected from an ocean of signed and filed documents?

Respectfully,

## Dear Senator

[Introduction omitted]

In my previous open letters to you, I respectfully attempted to ask you to please consider this a women’s, and American, if not Mass., children’s issue. As a beloved Harvard Law Professor and Dean, you may have known the also Harvard Law Alumni, but ultimately disbarred and rightfully “thrown out”, **Atty. Monroe Inker**, the proudly self-proclaimed “Father of Mass. Divorce Law”, and a predatory “feminist”.

Just as documented in my writings, I have personally known Atty. Inker and I have also personally experienced his ruthless, outright psychopath shenanigans, specifically related to cruelly torturing and abusing the children of divorcing parents. As per the Inker (and also his “lieutenant”, Atty. Gail Otis) “win-win” legal (or divorce) strategy, emotionally vulnerable mothers are seemingly forced by their “trusted Court officer” predators to self-incriminate in Court, thus “baiting” the stereotypical blind, naive and “unevolved” fathers into then openly “victimizing” the mothers in front of the judges.

The American Bar Association seems to also recognize certain “high-conflict” cases as “frequent fliers” or “10 percenters”. Since intractable divorce cases, with the leveraged children’s well being at their core, act like “pension plans” for the most rabid divorce attorneys, no wonder “high-conflict” in divorces is the sought after ultimate prize, the “goldmine”, for our most intelligent psychopaths. A well known, and allegedly $50B national “divorce industry”, a societal disgrace by itself, is thus only getting more influential and powerful at the detriment of our shamelessly, and profitably, tortured, yet silent children.

Growing up in a socialist society, where mothers and fathers were always equal “workers”, the ideals of “feminism” feel instinctively natural to me. As my parents are still married, my unconditional respect for women can also be considered “ingrained”. Having a deeper, more “practical” insight into the intentionally fuzzy definitions of “ownership” in socialism, I immediately focus on the “second order” thoughts: assuming goal accomplished, who are the saboteurs, the “enemy within”. Personal experiences have thought me that in socialism, where “everything is everyone’s”, everyone becomes a thief.

Not being gifted, I have no interest in politics, so I quickly turn to my objective. Assuming that the ideals of “feminism” are just as dear to you as are to me (I have two young daughters), you being our unchallenged feminist leader (in my view) and an effective law professor, will you, dear Senator of my home state, consider “going after” the most ruthless saboteurs of the feminist ideals: the truly “elite” professionals who, while hiding behind noble ideals, ruthlessly prey on our innocent children?

I am referring to **Dr. Robin Deutsch** and **Dr. Ronni Goldsmith**. Conspiring with an army of “feminist” lawyers, they not just preyed on children but also victimized their mothers, so much so that the mothers are now on government aid, and unable to even file a complaint of contempt for unpaid child supports.

Respectfully,

Note: **“Many consider him the father of modern family law”** as the linked [Boston Globe](generated/images/story/inker.pdf) article documents Atty. Monroe Inker’s story on November 13, 2005. I hereby respectfully request our favorite Boston Globe to allow me to reference a local verbatim .pdf copy of the revealing article since the original about this cruel, ruthless “feminist” child predator suddenly “disappeared” and cannot be linked any longer. In case my request for permission is denied, a broken link will signify my immediate and respectful compliance.

## Family Court forcing children into poverty

Dear First Justice,

[Introduction omitted]

As the presiding judge over one case, it was your Honor who summarily denied all my properly filed Pro Se motions as recently as February 20, 2019 while Judge Donnelly had still been the Court’s First Justice.

With all my net worth, including retirement, completely depleted and thus unable to continue to support my children at the unrealistic, fabricated level fraudulently mandated by the Court, I scheduled the first hearing to finally address the rampant fraud, subornation of perjury, misrepresentation, obstruction, lying and **sustained, systematic and institutionalized child abuse and torturing** on January 19, 2018.

The Cambridge Family Court, through the ensuing 9+ hearings with absolutely nothing acknowledged, solved nor even considered is seemingly fully intent on covering up the extensively documented past shenanigans of the Court’s “trusted professionals”, entirely at the expense of the involved 4 children.

During the April 24, 2019 hearing, scheduled by and started in your Honor’s courtroom, I was, perhaps intentionally, exposed to a “used up” black father being handcuffed on the spot and sent to jail for not having money for his white, seemingly a lawyer, ex-wife for child support. Just after the shocking public “assassination ceremony” of a father, suddenly our case and its foot-high file was transferred to a brand new judge and we were promptly moved to a previously sealed and now conveniently empty courtroom.

The new judge started with “denied, denied...” to all my properly resubmitted motions, without as much as reading the titles. My request to retroactively triple my child support for my dear children, in an effort to somehow repair what has been taken from us, stolen from us through the years, was also flatly denied.

She, the judge, then patiently listened, while approvingly and encouragingly nodding to the ~$500 per hour “prestigious” lawyers demanding immediate jail sentence for a “dangerous, very dangerous” father. In fact, that father is a loving, concerned and caring father who has not spared any effort nor expense to unconditionally support and to protect his dear children. The new judge, a “trainee” just in February, then silently dismissed my third motion about extensive factual proofs of ongoing deceit by the lawyers.

The judge then turned to me and started coldly lecturing in a **degrading, dehumanizing, devaluing and entirely invalidating** tone of voice about how I must go and find a minimum wage job, exactly like “your ex-wife has done, as she is now working at Whole Foods, Westford, as a proud cashier”. When I attempted to respond to her in any way, I was cut short and was never able to finish a single sentence.

I still tried to explain that my ex-wife can afford her luxury and ~$500 per hour lawyers, while being a handy “cashier”, because she was still a millionaire due to my software I had previously written and sold. The irate judge abruptly interrupted me by saying **“I don’t want to hear about your “software”, get a real job”**. Two advanced degrees, ~30 years of extensive experience, proven track record, current open source state-of-the-art AI software, etc. all meant nothing for the Court in their quest to forcefully silence a loving father. She then promptly prohibited any further motions to be submitted to the Court.

During the February 20, 2019, hearing, I explained to your Honor that the $70K salary I initially gave myself from my own savings was an unrealistically high “to support my children as much as possible” figure, intended to last until the false, fraudulent and utterly malicious #MeToo-type rape, child abuse, possible personality disorders, “toxic masculinity”, etc. accusations became discredited by the Court.

Despite what **Atty. Michael Xavier (BBO 644844)** had been falsely and fraudulently claiming to you, I also argued then that the parallel case presided by Hon. Judge Black had still been a reality. That judge has recently scheduled the parallel pre-trial conference, with emphasis on child support, for August 7.

The sad reality of the parallel case, that of an utterly threatened and victimized mother of little children, who had been shamelessly robbed of hundreds of thousands of her dollars by this “free for all” Family Court’s unrestrained, predatory feminist attorneys and had been pushed into paralyzing poverty, is the now factually urgent need for government assistance and taxpayer subsidized child support / insurance.

Couple that with the cruel, professionally assassinating threat of a “suspended 20 day jail sentence” for the father, ordered on April 24, 2019, by the new, thoroughly prejudiced and the 6th sudden judge in the matters, and the Family Court’s true intent seems to slowly emerge: blatantly coerce a highly-educated, able, capable, eager to support his children father into a numbing minimum wage job, only to somehow silence him already, along with his advanced, narrative reporting software product. Hence, I seem to now have a concrete, irrefutable basis to question your Honor’s February 20, 2019 ruling for increasing child support (by $20 to $255) to a millionaire, when the taxpayers are paying $342 to the silent mother.

Moreover, according to the published current child support guidelines, and considering a now secured, **but unaccepted**, offer for a guaranteed $3 above minimum “Whole Foods cashier-wage” salary for father, the child support amounts should be $105 and $130 with a total of $235 combined (see attached), instead of a faulty $255 to one mother only, again the millionaire one with the ~$500 per hour lawyer.

As the status quo-“ship has sailed”, meaning that I cannot possibly subsidize the Court’s current, and fraudulent child supports any longer with my completely depleted net worth, the Family Court needs to decide if they want to continue covering up for the past ruthless, cruel, yet also extensively documented shenanigans of “trusted” professionals. **This would mean actively driving the 4 children into poverty**.

Alternatively, the Court, after the requested proper investigations, could finally decide that a loving and caring father, and his entire family, had been maliciously wronged and deep, fundamental changes, along with necessary retroactive reparations for caused damages, would be in order. A simple finding, based on all well established and verifiable written documentation, would enable a father, and a highly-educated professional, to clear his name and to resume his life as a justified, defensible and sustainable top-earner.

As per [salary stats](https://www.levels.fyi/charts.html) and considering my above mentioned ~30 years of extensive experience and proven track record, I could possibly “reboot” my public professional life and take on $500+ per hour steady, software consulting/contracting assignments, conditioned only by the Family Court finally clearing the maliciously and fraudulently injected “#MeToo assassinations”.

During the February 20, 2019, hearing, your Honor also assigned **ARC Atty. John Ronan (BBO 659393)** to “protect” the children. My opposing motion requesting a protective professional trained to **“do no harm”** was simply ignored, as usual. The lawyer wrote: *“My job is to represent your children and let the court know what their position is, not what my recommendations would be if I were a GAL”*. He then went on to testify on April 24, 2019 that the children “don’t ever want to have any connection with their father” and conspiringly convinced the judge that I was “dangerous” because “father sent me 16 emails”.

The same attorney then seemingly conspired with Atty. Xavier to knowingly mislead a Pro Se litigant regarding well established “Pre-Trial Conference” orders to derail lawful prosecution of my complaint. Atty. Ronan seemingly knowingly engaged in obstruction while “protecting the children”.

Respectfully,

## Hasty, communist-style “show trial” in Cambridge

Dear First Justice,

The case your Honor presided over until the sudden switch of judges midday on April 24, 2019, a pre-scheduled hearing day for us, had a sudden, hasty trial and a judgment was issued on June 13. On June 25, I filed a Notice of Appeal and the Family Court acknowledged receipt of the notice on July 1, 2019.

Just before the trial started in the afternoon of June 6, the presiding judge ordered me into handcuffs in the morning and then **ordered me to accept a minimum wage job** at noon, seemingly acknowledging that with the malicious (and utterly false) allegations against me, I had no chance of supporting my 4 children otherwise. This came after the 8 hearings I had initiated in vain to get **relief for my children**.

As the judge continued to ignore my many filed motions, in which I had been also seeking relief from the still accumulating false allegations, as well as the open and largely identical **parallel case**, the MA DOR notified me on June 13 of suspending my driver’s / professional licenses for lack of child support.

Specifically, during the February 20 hearing, I argued to you personally that the parallel case, presided by Judge Black and taken over by the MA DOR just the day before, had still been open and ongoing, despite the seeming exclusivity for your case, that Atty. Xavier had been deceivingly claiming to you.

With no relief provided by the Court, and not even a valid driver’s license, I received a minimum wage 1099 contract offer and I immediately accepted it following the June 6 trial. I have diligently restarted paying weekly child support since then to both open cases. While actively looking for better pay, inline with my skills and education, I currently cannot afford the expenses an appeal urgently imposes on me.

The Court may argue that not affording an appeal should mean no appeal. As Chief Justice Hon. John D. Casey, Probate and Family Court, Administrative Office, wrote to me personally on March 6, 2019, “all employees of the Court **must remain neutral and impartial**”, I now firmly believe that the June 13 judgment is legally wrong. Please consider the following as my summary justification for appealing.

As per [starting an appeal](https://www.mass.gov/guides/requirements-for-starting-an-appeal-in-each-trial-court-department), I also understand that “*An appellate court will not overturn any factual findings by a judge unless **there was no evidence** before the court that supported the finding or if the evidence against that finding was so overwhelming that **no rational person could make that finding**. The appellate court can only reverse the trial court's decision if it finds a legal mistake in the trial court proceedings, or a clearly erroneous finding, that was so important that it changed at least part of the outcome of the case. Because of this heavy burden on the appellant to prove this type of mistake, it is quite difficult to win an appeal*".

Accordingly, my points below need to prove at least one of the three criteria: a) the Court was biased or partial, b) finding had no evidence to build on and c) finding was not rational per common sense logic.

1. I filed many motions requesting relief in both open cases. It was your Honor, and also Judge Black for the parallel case, who read the simultaneous and identical titles during the hearings. **None of the motions nor representations were considered**, nor even their existence mentioned in the judgment.

2. **Every motion by attorneys**, regardless of how deceiving or factually wrong, was promptly adopted.

3. I have meticulously prepared, listed and brought with me to every hearing 40 categories (677 pages) of verifiable exhibits. **Not a single exhibit was accepted** by the Court, not even during the trial.

4. I have filed over 256 pages of signed affidavits with the Court. It was your Honor who accepted 72 pages during the February 20 hearing. **Not a single affidavit was mentioned** in the judgment.

5. Every motion was simultaneously and identically filed with both parallel cases, with both mothers’ names and docket numbers clearly marked on all of them. **Never was the existence of the open “parallel case” acknowledged** by the Court. On June 6, just before the handcuffing, Atty. Xavier finally admitted that there was in fact a parallel case. The judge said *“that’s good to know”* without giving any consideration to how child support amounts would be affected by that “material change”.

6. I properly filed a Pre-Trial Conference Memo listing both mothers as witnesses. As false claims of “mental health” concerns were made, I listed the 3 Harvard psychiatry professors, who had spent significant time with me assuring me of not being any danger to my children, as witnesses. I listed the much debated supervised visitation monitor as my witness. **No witnesses were allowed at trial**.

7. With none of the filed motions considered, none of the affidavits acknowledged, none of the exhibits ever accepted, with the judge herself bullying the acceptance of a minimum wage job, **a significant material change by itself** just before the trial, the judgment still claims that the *“[he] failed to meet the burden of showing material change... as he was unable to cogently provide adequate grounds”*.

8. On June 6, the Court requested the “Finding of Facts/Proposed Judgments” to be sent within a week. I mailed my document on June 13, within an hour of Atty. Xavier mailing his. And I received the attorney’s envelope in the mail on June 18. Nevertheless, the judgment was signed on June 13, proving that the Court **had no intention whatsoever of ever considering** my “Finding of Facts”.

9. Only the two financial statements were accepted during the trial. Mother stated $15,729 “incurred” and $18,000 “anticipated” for legal fees on May 31. Mother was accompanied at all times by a lawyer charging ~$500 / hour on June 6, a full day of 3 hearing phases/trial. The Court was not given any other “legal expense” figure at the time. Suddenly, Atty. Xavier claimed in his affidavit, signed and mailed on June 13, a seemingly random $13,934 for his expenses. The Court, by “sure magic”, incorporated that same $13,934 into the judgment on June 13. But rationally, there is no magic. The Court provenly **communicated with one party while refusing all communication with the other**.

10. My properly filed “Finding of Facts” relied on the accepted financial statement and the restricted trial testimony. Based on **irrefutable elementary math on the stated figures** in Mother’s statement, I clearly concluded “*Her now fully documented reckless and selfish financial history and spending patterns constitute significant material changes directly affecting the well-being of her children*".

11. The Court’s thus **purposeful bias against accepting any statements from me** and its intention to conduct a pre-arranged, prejudiced “show trial” from the beginning is evidenced by “*the Court finds that Mother will continue to promote the best interest of [children] which she has demonstrated*".

12. Without any evidence, the Court accepted “*Mother testified... Father continues to send contentious and inflammatory e-mails regarding this matter*”. Yet the Court knowingly ignored my filed motions and exhibits of the 166 verifiable emails regularly sent to somehow stop Mother’s then **weekly cruel provocations, abuse and endless torturing of children** during the 5 years of supervised visitations.

13. The Court unconditionally accepting “*Mother... testified... children had been... in ongoing therapy from 2011- 2017 to deal with endured trauma and abuse sustained from their relationship with Father*” seemingly implies that mandated supervised visitation programs directly sustain and cause trauma and abuse in children, as I have not seen the children outside of supervision **that entire time**.

14. Deceivingly confirming “*Father testified... he never received complaints throughout the two-year... supervised parenting time*”, the Court **intently minimized** my 5 years of no-issues supervised visits.

15. Despite the Court confirming Mother’s **uncorroborated need for ongoing therapy** for the children during the entire 5 years of no-issues supervised visitations, the Court still seems incredulous with “*Father testified that he believed the parenting time facilitators were "waterboarding" his children*“.

16. The Court then **intently misinterprets my attempt to protect my children** from the 5 years of abuse, despite the repeatedly filed motions and denied exhibits “*Father... testified that he made the decision to unilaterally terminate visitations because 1) he believed Ms. Brice could no longer conduct visitations, and 2) he did not wish to make his children feel uncomfortable in participating*”.

17. The Court unconditionally credits Mother “*she had always encouraged the children to participate in parenting time and hoped... relationship... would be repaired*”. Yet on the same page, the Court **fails to recognize the abusive contradiction** “*Mother... expressed... she did not want to disrupt the children's wellbeing by making them spend time with someone who makes them feel uncomfortable*”.

18. The Court credits “*Mother testified... Father’s unilateral cancellation of supervised visits made the children feel rejected*” and **in preparation** accepts “*Father also testified that he continued to have telephone conversations with the children following the termination of supervised parenting time*”.

19. During the December 17, 2018 hearing, Atty. Otis claimed to your Honor both orally and in writing, that “*no material changes have occurred*” and “**Father talks to his children every other night**”.

20. As I never missed calling my children and they **always** called me back, the Court needs to **fabricate a necessary narrative** “*Father... testified that beginning in June 2017, the children no longer wanted to talk to him and stopped answering his telephone calls... he has continued to call the children... in hopes that they will eventually answer his calls*” for a “children rejected Dad” finding.

21. While my repeatedly filed motions and many emphatic verbal pleadings to “**immediately reconnect children with Father**” and to “**restart visits**” were flat out ignored, the Court still unconditionally finds “*Mother testified... there has been no effort on Father's part since 2016 to set-up visitations*”.

22. I also testified that Atty. Otis had been actively and continuously involved with the case between 2011 to 2019, and through threats, bullying and fraud she has made **any normalization impossible**. Even Atty. Xavier admitted during the trial that I could not have gotten around Atty. Otis. The Court still **ignored noting the obstructing existence of any hurdles** purposefully enacted by the Court.

23. Despite the admission, Atty. Xavier still made no attempt to correct his record to the Court regarding the “birthday email”. As I could not contact Mother and my children directly, per the rules of the Court, I sent a heartfelt email directly to Xavier, wishing my children a “Happy Birthday”. Having no reason to doubt Mother not relaying such email from her lawyer to my children, I can only conclude that Atty. Xavier **maliciously withheld a loving father’s heartfelt email to his children**.

24. The only other exhibits allowed by the Court were the two reports by the forcefully appointed ARC Atty. Ronan. In it **Ronan, seemingly conspiring with Xavier**, states “*The children stated how he didn't call on the children's birthday and they do not receive presents*”. Ronan never attempted to verify anything for his clients’ sake, despite him claiming “*My job is to represent your children and let the court know what their position is, not what my recommendations would be if I were a GAL*”.

25. My phone service was disconnected due to not having any funds to pay for the bills just as Atty. Xavier entered his appearance. Not being able to contact Mother directly, I sent Xavier an "Phone Calls To My Children" email “*I just wanted to let you know that I still continue to call my children. My phone still logs the calls. However, AT&T has suspended my account and the calls don’t complete anymore” along with “I can still be reached through the internet for free (Skype, FaceTime, etc., the options are limitless and **I fully intend to make all efforts and use all options available to me** to call my children*”.

26. Seemingly Xavier conspired with Ronan once again, as Ronan never attempted to clarify why the children felt that their father “suddenly stopped calling them”. Clearly Xavier did not forward my Court-required communications to Mother. The Court **refused to accept any evidence or exhibits regarding the ARC**, and blatantly disrupted me and overruled me when I wanted to voice my disagreement with the ARC hastily withdrawing from the case, without clarifications to the Court.

27. The Court still finds “*Based on the ARC's updated statement, both children remain adamant regarding their choice and position to not have a relationship with Father. From the children's perspective, the relationship has been terminated by the Father after he stopped parenting time and his phone calls. Furthermore, both [children] have expressed that they do not want to see the Father or communicate with him in any form*”. **No rational, child-loving person could make that finding**.

28. As forcefully and purposefully appointing a deeply corrupt, child-predator ARC for the fatherless children successfully concludes the **carefully orchestrated Communist-style “show trial”**, the Court doubles down “*The Court further finds that a change in modification of parenting time would not be in the best interests of the children since they have expressed through the ARC statement that their relationship with Father is irretrievably broken and there is no hope for reconciliation*”.

29. While the repeatedly filed motions and many emphatic verbal arguments, specifically requesting to “immediately reconnect children with Father”, were flat out ignored by the Court, somehow the Court continues to fabricate “*Father expressed many times throughout his testimony that he always honored his children's wishes and intends to continue doing so*”, thus maliciously suggesting that, perhaps as **“rationale” for the wrongful judgment**, I was ready to walk away from my children.

30. The outright sloppiness and carelessness of the Court is also shocking: the trial was held on June 6, and not June 5. The previous judgment did not have “*court-ordered therapy*” for me. Mother never testified that "*the girls are in a good place*” as **we have a boy and a girl** since they were born...

31. Despite the long list of **verifiable cruel and ruthless gaming of families**, the Court still “*finds that there has not been a material change in circumstances to support a modification on Father's complaint due to the children's choice and positions regarding their relationship with Father*”.

Once again, this is only a starting summary of what I believe can successfully be expanded into an appeal brief worth considering by the Appeals Court and what is also a clearly essential future protection of the wellbeing of the innocent tortured, abused and ruthlessly “gamed”, by the Family Court, children.

Your Honor, I hereby respectfully request the Family Court to please consider allowing my application for paid Court expenses, as the attached standard “Affidavit Of Indigency” show, I simply have no available funds to pay for the request for “tapes” and the upcoming appeals-related Court expenses.

Respectfully,

## Court bars uniquely relevant witnesses from trial

Dear Chief Justices,

I am publicly writing to you once again before the now **13th hearing in a row**, in just the last year or so, regarding the massive, multi-million dollar parallel lawsuits, directly targeting and ruthlessly victimizing four children. I am forwarding this open letter to our elected officials and publishing at the link below.

While referring to the above websites for traceable details, the essentials lie in lawyers knowingly and maliciously morphing jealousy and greed-based facts into a long-term family tragedy. Specifically, they even resorted to systematic subornation of perjury to deceive the Family Court into believing that I was the one somehow “hiding” the millions of dollars that the “rich” Mother still keeps in her accounts.

On August 7, 2019, the “poor” Mother claimed ~$2K in assets and $30K in liabilities in her under oath statement. She had also *“**paid $103,000**, past legal fees, to get through Father’s previous actions”*. The Court, however, has already found that *“in May 2011, [she] filed the Complaint contained herein”* and that *“[she] testified that Father made several attempts to settle this case...[she] declined all of [his] offers”*. Recently, she has been outright ignoring my countless requests for normalization and settling.

Both lawsuits started with the lawyers baiting the mothers, by repeatedly reassuring them that all their churned “legal fees” would be reimbursed. The “poor” Mother was blatantly promised **~$10,000 / per month** child support, while the lawyers knowing fully, with repeated bank subpoenas in their hands, that the possible figure would be 10-times less. Considering the children, the Court ordered Mother to “work” for a living. Her August 7, 2019, statement lists a **$7,800** “gross yearly income from prior year.”

On August 8, 2019, she also filed an opposition recapping that the above judgment *“was the result of an extensive 4 day trial... with 25 pages of supporting [document]”*. Nevertheless, the actual 44 pages of the blatantly fraudulent and maliciously filed “rationale” also demanded that *“Father shall reimburse Mother for **$163,399.76 of legal fees**”*. The Court’s denial of **any** reimbursement, however, directly invalidates the lawyers’ “fishing expeditions,” as $60K+ in billed “legal fees” has thus never been paid.

On August 8, 2019, Mother also writes under oath that *“Father’s claim, six years later, that it was the result of fraud, lies, perjury, and being bullied is ludicrous.”* Yet in the same blatantly fraudulent and malicious “rationale” filed with the Court, the lawyers claim *“Mother writes about the dates around [daughter’s] conception **but maintains that she was raped** August 25, 2010”*. The “RAPE” caused a lot of commotion during the trial, yet the female judge never once mentioned it in her conflicted judgment.

As rape accusations rightfully never expire, the malicious falsity of rape accusations should not expire either. My response to a **ridiculing Mother** reads: *“False RAPE, child abuse, bullying, “personality disorder” are not “unrelated”... and if you feel that none of those personally attacking and utterly destroying accusations, that your lawyers signed and filed with the Court, while extorting astronomical amounts of money from all of us, has anything to do with you, then just state [it] clearly to the judge.”*

Having learned from the lawyers’ endless shenanigans of them forcefully splitting me up into disjointed halves, I have been simultaneously referring to both cases in my identically filed documents. On August 8, 2019, Mother admits under oath that *“Father creates tremendous confusion... Mother at times cannot decipher which documents were actually filed or not”*. She then claims that *“Mother first received... Motion... Pre-Trial Memorandum... on August 8, 2019, one day after the Pre-Trial Conference”*. Signed notices and certificates, as well as proofs of mailing and emailing, verify that I have been properly, as per the rules, communicating. Mother seems to **refuse to accept notices** or to consider anything at all.

Moreover, on August 8, 2019, Mother also states under oath that *“An in-person meeting between the parties... was not possible because the parties cannot communicate” and “Facts the parties disagree to: almost everything.”* She then adds, *“Discovery has not been completed because Mother cannot afford an attorney and cannot communicate with Father.”* Is unilaterally refusing to communicate, e.g., to merely accept a timely sent notice for a Court-filing, in the **best interests of the cruelly alienated children**?

Mother’s under oath clinging to conveniently fabricated fairy tales about “hidden millions” is thus not surprising: *“[Father] still chose to not only remain unemployed but also spent all his millions of dollars... $3M over eight years works out to $7,211 per week.”* I, however, kept meticulous records of all my expenses, tracing virtually every penny I have had since the beginning. As Mass. taxpayers are now financing Mother’s unhinged fantasies, perhaps it is time for the Court to finally “do the numbers.”

Further troubling contradictions regarding our taxpayers’ money seem to hide in the filed documents. As per the Court’s June 6, 2019, “handcuffing” direct order, I have accepted a minimum wage 1099 software contract and immediately started sending weekly checks to the DOR, for now, a total of 10 checks, or $1,040. I have bank statements verifying the cleared “Comm. of Mass.” checks. As per their August 15, 2019, statement, I owe the DOR $7,686.16, or a weekly $427.50 for the actual **$342 child support paid** to Mother by the DOR. While the DOR has not credited any of my cleared $1,040, Mother states under oath on August 8, 2019, *“Mother receives, as of June 19, 2019, **$104 per week**.”*

Adding to her significant numeric contradictions, Mother, while ignoring anything sent to her, insinuates “mental health” issues in her August 8, 2019, filings: *“Father’s Motion is **delusional** in that it discusses dates and Judgments that never happened in this case, requests a “stay” on a pleading that Father himself complains of being “ignored” on... and permission to file a motion on parenting time, which has already been Denied.”* The Court can easily verify these sorts of “delusions,” as the identical pleadings are being seemingly prepared for forwarding to the Appeals Court, with the Court **expenses waived**.

The adversarial, and thus deeply conflicted, Family Court has actively steered the massive lawsuits to be built on three fabricated “pillars” of convenient stereotypically male premises: a) I am “hiding millions”, b) I have “mental health” issues and c) I still can be an unconditionally successful “elite” professional. During the August 7, 2019, pre-trial conference, **a now seventh** Family Judge seemingly intended to continue to reinforce and maintain the Court’s apparent ideological and child abusive operating dogmas.

While proclaiming that she would not allow the trial to delve into “5+ years old issues” or to become a “forum for a father”, she denied allowing the **only qualified and knowledgeable witness**, the “rich” Mother, to confirm the otherwise documented facts about where the “hidden millions” of dollars have “vanished”. Seemingly any testimony about the allowed subornation of perjuries “must be denied.”

The Court’s original judgment orders *“It is in the best interest of the children that Father continues to receive individual therapy. Father shall continue to attend individual therapy sessions”*. From day one I have sought out the absolute best therapy anyone can get: I have spent ~400 billed hours with three of the most highly recommended Harvard Medical School psychiatry professors, medical doctors sworn to “do no harm.” In a seeming agreement, they stated in writing that I was **not a danger** to my children.

Since the original judgment, I have actively engaged myself in a perhaps most successful “**million-dollar therapy**” as I have forwarded every single of my hundreds and hundreds of self-validating, self-reflective, unapologetic and deeply self-exposing emails to my three dear therapists. Just like the most successful psychology experiment, the “Radio Free Europe” initiative against the ruthless communist tyrannies, the Harvard professors “**listened**” for years now, with occasionally signaling their presence.

As a continuation of their initially laid out CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), the respected Harvard professors’ continuous monitoring of my thoughts, **in my perception**, much protected me from the predatory and dogmatic actions of the Family Court and its ruthless and greedy “trusted” professionals.

The new judge still denied my chance of asking my three therapists, during the “forum of justice,” about their expert professional opinions regarding the progress of my years-long, Court-ordered therapy. In a perhaps cover-up move, for the child predator and 400 times GAL Dr. Deutsch, the Court denied once again hearing about anything the **most qualified** three psychology professionals could say about me.

Mother states in her August 8, 2019, filings that: *“With Father's money “all gone”, rather than find a position that utilizes his education and skills (a software engineer with 2 masters degrees) that would provide for his children, he claims he has chosen to accept a 2 month 1099 minimum wage contract “job” from a friend. Something that will be expired by the time the parties even reach their Trial date.”*

The minimum wage contract, directly ordered by the “handcuffing” Court and provided by the “friend,” will expire in the next few weeks, as soon as I have the easily verifiable and publicly accessible proof of my “full-stack” (i.e., both front-end and back-end, production-level skills) developer status completed.

Mother’s “nothing else counts” stance is exposed in her claim: *“When the Guidelines Worksheet is completed... weekly Child Support would be $151 per week.”* As one’s checkbook cannot be balanced based on “feelings,” and I have to support four children, not just the two that Mother “feels” that I have, the official child supports end up being $104 /week, a seemingly **state minimum of $52 /child/week**.

Mother then claims: *“When the Guidelines is completed using a salary Father **is easily capable of**, if he chose to work”* and *“Mother **thinks** Father should start earning a salary of what he is capable of ($100,000+) and start providing for his children.”* As the last few months unambiguously prove, the highly toxic nature of the subject matter and the Court’s total lack of any resolve, not even the 800+ sent emails and countless official letters will entice any businesses to even consider the “**#MeToo-villain-like**” software engineer. The MA DOR suspending my licenses, not having a car, a phone, any assets, any savings, any insurance, nor any rights to even call witnesses during my trials, doesn’t help either.

On August 7, 2019, the new judge claimed that the Court was not forcing me to have an income of $100K+. Just two days before, in the adjacent courtroom, I was directly ordered, yet again under the dire threat of a “**suspended jail sentence**,” to start paying the “rich” Mother the child support fraudulently determined 5+ years ago. Anyone respecting both judges, and their “excluding the other” orders, would immediately conclude that the rulings are mathematically impossible, as only having a $100K+ income (1099-based, to simplify payroll taxes) can pay for the Family Court’s orders issued 5+ years ago.

In my field of software engineering, $100K+ is the starting salary for someone just out of college. As I have 30+ years of active, up-to-date and highly competitive skills and expertise, any business offering me “just” $100K+ would rightfully face an eventual “**employment discrimination**” lawsuit, just as soon as the Appeals Court has a verdict. Otherwise, the nationally well-known **#MeToo wrath** would descend on any hiring manager, for him ignoring the countless predatory lawyers’ “fishing expedition”-like filings and ruthless “dangerous” accusations, openly allowed, even subsidized by the activist Court.

Respectfully,
