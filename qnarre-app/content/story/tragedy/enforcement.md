# Dear Law Enforcement

{@a top}

I am writing to you in reference to my herein attached letter to the First Justice of the Family Court.

The matters outlined in the referenced letter are about a series of systematic, and allegedly criminal, activities that took place in Cambridge over the span of years. Little children and their deeply victimized parents were targeted by seasoned and informed professionals.

The objective of this letter is to expand on said allegations and to provide information regarding the seemingly wider scope of the referenced and allegedly coordinated activities.

Should you consider the matters to be falling under your investigative jurisdiction, I hereby also voluntarily and respectfully offer to share the collection of relevant documentation in my possession and not subject to the said standing orders by the Middlesex Family Court.

## Victimizing mothers: "win-win" strategy

Atty. Monroe Inker, a self-described "father of Mass. divorce law", personally introduced the essence of his "win-win" divorce strategy to me while I was still a "trusted insider" in my ex-wife's, Ms. Rutland's, divorce proceedings from her first husband. The strategy, and the created sad behavior patterns, are the root causes for the actions described in these letters.

The ruthless predatory strategy is as follows: provoke the father out-of-court by torturing his children and he will stereotypically respond by attacking the mother in-court, i.e. openly "victimizing" her in front of the judge. Repeat this until the father breaks down either by abandoning his children or by being ordered out of the life of his children by the court.

Strategies have weak points. This high stakes legal "gaming" targeting children is limited only by how far the mother is willing to go in punishing her children. And by how much the attorneys are able to professionally stomach. In the case of ruthless, psychopath lawyers this "shortcoming" can be mitigated by them by first incriminating the emotional mother.

Ms. Rutland was victorious in driving her first son's father into abandoning his only son for only ~\$300K paid to Inker. As intentionally created existential fear is the basis of turning entire societies into pawns by tyrannical dictators, she, as a highly intelligent woman, realized soon after our divorce that she could easily become the target of the same ruthless strategy.

## Abused daughters: "unregulated" targets

Ms. Woburn, the other mother (with a clean 6 month gap between relationships), impressed me with her love for and joy of being with children. She came at a time when my 3 yo twins were still struggling from the sudden loss of their mother (see attached letter). That bond developed into love, engagement, a desire for life together and 2 children from 3 pregnancies.

I learned about the cruelty in the Woburn family from the "little daughter crying while her brothers were beaten bloody", through the sole cousin, daughter's "soul-mate", melting from the inside by drinking plumber's Drano at 40 and the mother responding to her daughter's suicide cries with a "she does it all the time, get used to it" to the "my family will kill me".

I witnessed the extent of Ms. Woburn's troubles at the "great family tradition" Christmas party. Her excitement to introduce our 6 months old son to the family turned into sadistic torture as her mother never once looked at the baby, never talked to her daughter. "She ignored us in front of my entire family" cried Ms. Woburn all the way home. She was 38 then.

Always poor and working her way through college, Ms. Woburn was easily affected by money. My delusionally sounding Inker experiences combined with her lack of emotional regulating skills, a traumatizing miscarriage followed by tragically bleeding pregnancies and existential threats from a vastly more experienced Ms. Rutland turned Ms. Woburn into an ideal prey.

Attys. Foley, Apelgren, Macadie, Menard, Iannuzzi and LaCivita quickly seized on Ms. Woburn as their ideal victim. While they had full voluntary and multiple subpoenaed disclosures of my finances, they still promised her the impossible \$10K / month child support, payment of all legal expenses and full control of the children completely alienated from their father.

## Collusion with the alleged federal crime?

In collusion with Atty. Otis' alleged federal crime (see attached letter), Ms. Woburn only had to maintain the lie that I somehow miraculously kept millions of dollars and was hiding them as LaCivita shamelessly speculated in writing to the Court about tens of millions. All the usable, left-over money was in fact "hidden" in Ms. Rutland's personal brokerage accounts.

Despite my desperate efforts to settle with Ms. Woburn, her attorneys would not let go. They seemingly flipped sides and were in fact protecting Ms. Rutland at the detriment of their own client. They churned and extorted $70K, $110K and ultimately a claimed \$163K out of a mother with no savings, no job, no skills to emotionally self-regulate and 3 little children.

The attorneys advertising themselves as "feminist" (i.e. protecting women) seemingly "locked" Ms. Woburn in by first coercing the mother to the stand, during the sham RO hearing in the Concord courthouse and the forced trial in Cambridge, and shrewdly letting her incriminate, and utterly scare, herself by her repeating her assaults on 4 yo children over and over again.

The attorneys also reaffirmed Dr. Deutsch's, the 400+ times GAL in the other case, overriding voice and status in the Court. They claimed that both cases ought to be based on the doctor's malicious "boiler-plated" fairytale, despite her "observation" of Ms. Woburn incessantly beating her child (Dr. Deutsch never contacted anyone outside Ms. Rutland's "witnesses").

**It all came to a head when Dr. Somers, the appointed GAL in the Ms. Woburn case, flat out lied to the judge regarding me not following his mandated therapy.**

He had known about the 3 Harvard psychiatry professors spending ~400 hours with me (paid over \$200K), the dual extensive psychiatry tests by them concluding that I was "not a threat to my children" and, of course, the dire, and materialized, Inker/Otis/Deutsch threat.

Dr. Somers testified just after our lengthy hallway discussion about the vast and ruthless Deutsch "feeder network", their seemingly fraudulent charges (over $40K for the Deutsch investigation vs. $7K total for the more complete Somers investigation) and the mental health effect of all this on children. Atty. Harris refused my request for the trial transcripts.

## Lying to the police, false arrest

Understanding how the Inker strategy by ruthless lawyers cuts both ways by "cleverly" preying on and targeting helpless parents, Ms. Rutland became genuinely threatened by any relationships of mine. Shortly after our divorce finalized, and she deposited all the money, she grew into obsessing about lawyers and has started incessantly threatening with lawsuits.

She also seemingly decided to take things into her hands and started to intentionally poke and provoke the highly sensitized situation. The sickness of the children, the horrific miscarriage, the financial malaise of late 2008 and the tragic, heavily bleeding new pregnancy filled our plates already. Yet Ms. Rutland kept repeating "I will put that whore, that cancer in jail".

Ms. Rutland took our daughter to preschool while I was with our son in the hospital, just as the Court noted blindly, with no concern of the terrifying context. Predictably, as her only opportunity to "run into" Ms. Woburn, Ms. Rutland openly and publicly harassed the other desperate, and pregnant, mother so that the preschool staff had to order them outside.

Hearing about the horrific details of the Inker strategy, and the cardinal rule of being first to call the police, Ms. Woburn became terrified. She would wake at night in sweat, yelling at me "do something about your f\*\* wife, control her already". The consequences of her emotional requests meant abandonment of my children and I refused. So, she lashed out at them.

Concerned for her pregnant wellbeing, I explained to Ms. Woburn next morning that the children had informed Ms. Rutland about her assault. In panic she first tried calling Ms. Rutland. She then said, holding her phone up to me, "I call the police first and you fix this". The Concord police arrested me shortly after with "strangling a pregnant woman".

A few days later, and before the arraignment hearing, Ms. Woburn begged me crying to rent an apartment for her because her father was forcing her to get an abortion and she could not stay with her parents any longer. I immediately obliged to save her and the baby. The Woburns urged her to take my house over. The judge refused to kick me and children out.

## Withholding child abuse from DCF

The 4 yo twins called Ms. Rutland the night before the above arrest, just as every night. They started by telling her how Ms. Woburn had been mad, yelling and that she spat in their and their father's faces. They sounded confused and troubled. I confirmed to Ms. Rutland the events. She immediately informed me that spitting at children is an assault and battery.

Next day, after my arrest, DCF was called to the house. From their report I learned that they interviewed Ms. Rutland as well, in person. But there was no mention of Ms. Woburn assaulting the children. Ms. Rutland responded to my observation: "I will put that cancer in jail with your own court testimony that you will give against her just to stay out of jail".

Ms. Woburn pleaded the fifth shortly after, DCF conducted a 4 month long investigation, noting the virtually impossible dynamic caused by the ex-spouses in our relationship, and essentially concluded that her and I will need magical powers to overcome the odds. We got engaged a month later. The Court only noted "Father was thrown in jail" from the drama.

Ms. Rutland's threats did not stop. In two years I was threatened 16 times to immediately obey her wishes or otherwise face "her lawyers". After our baby was born, and just before kindergarten started for the children, the stress level was once again ratcheted up to maximum. Ms. Woburn, perhaps experiencing post-partum depression as well, lashed out once again.

Ms. Woburn scared my daughter with a knife. She meant no harm, as she later testified. Ms. Rutland was notified by the children. Considering the seriousness of the situation, and to protect everyone, including the children, my 2 month old baby and Ms. Woburn as well, I personally moved Ms. Woburn and baby away from the twins, just as I reported to DCF.

Ms. Rutland reacted in the "legal" way: "I will wait for the school to report the incident to DCF and then I will put her in jail with your testimony". My daughter described the incident in great vivid detail to her teacher on the first day of kindergarten. DCF was called immediately. And they promptly closed the matter after hearing about my protective steps.

DCF noted the kindergarten teacher reporting the incident in vivid detail as if it had happened just two days before. In fact the incident happened 9 days before with Ms. Rutland sitting on her daughter being "threatened with a knife" for more than a week. Having had concluded the danger of the ex-spouses' mean manipulations, DCF seemingly saw through the matter.

**The Court denied my attempt to introduce the DCF report as an exhibit regarding Ms. Rutland's muted and calculating reaction to the "knife incident".**

## "Sex addict... sexually exploited... rape"

Trapped by Atty. Foley's self-serving complaint for a restraining order, Ms. Woburn was coerced to admit under oath spitting in the children's faces and the "knife incident", despite her having had pled the fifth about the matter. Her testimony of the knife incident's late reporting was not noted. On the way out Ms. Rutland threatened "she will get 6 months".

In court the attorneys continued to liberally make malicious and existentially threatening false accusations: "father is a sex addict", he "sexually exploited", **"raped"** mother. Ms. Woburn's desperate "sign over half of your big house or I will say that you raped me", perhaps caused by "my family will kill me if they find out", was seized and twisted by the ruthless professionals.

**Dr. Somers, the appointed GAL, took the false rape allegations seriously and confirmed in his report that rape did not happen. The "hijacked" Ms. Woburn clarified in personal email that our little daughter was conceived "out of love".**

## Concord, Westford MA, Hudson NH schools

The essential ingredient of any sham, "win-win" strategy and flat-out fraud is the conveniently fragmented realities, with no hope of piecing things together. Inker was successful with all those "high-conflict" divorce cases because by the time the fathers made sense of all the lying and fraud thrown at them, him and his clients have already easily "circled the globe".

Mr. Donovan, Ms. Rutland's first son attended 7 different schools in his first 9 years of schooling. Inker applauded her, as his predatory feminist "empowering women" strategy has always included the "move, the more the better" mantra. The objective was to provoke resistance from the father by him "encroaching on liberties of women", regardless of children.

I do not consider women "mine". Both Ms. Rutland and Ms. Woburn have threatened me with their "other options". I never once resisted either from moving on, "whatever makes you happy" was my answer. I was used to uncertainty, I lived together with Ms. Rutland for 13 years and never once met a single friend of hers from her "always on the move" past.

Understanding the Inker predatory "smarts", I had no difficulty not resisting the never ending motions for uprooting the children physically, mentally or socially. I understood the Inker trap and patiently went with the flow without being pulled into it. My objective was simple: meticulously document everything until it was time to publicly defragment reality.

I have transcripts from the first hearing, when the first fraudulent affidavit was presented to the Court, through the hearings where Atty. Otis was telling the Court that DCF recommended "an hour a month" visits with father (DCF confirmed they would never do that). Otis accused the Concord school with allowing beating of children without reporting.

Then the children were moved to Hudson, NH. Suddenly the children's numerous friends from before turned into "mean kids", the beloved Concord elementary school and all "really fun" activities became "hated". And "Hudson is nice, the best" was quickly reported. It then became evident that I would not stereotypically resist in court but still would do trial.

Trial in NH for Otis was not doable. The children were moved back to Westford. The reports started trickling in: the kids in NH "are mean and stupid", the school was "bad, poor". I had established a nice email rapport with the Hudson teachers by then. The children stabilized and were doing great. Otis claimed in Court that I had an affair with the teacher.

Establishing a rapport with the teachers in Westford quickly turned impossible. The trial became dragged out and was delayed several times. A father with a healthy relationship with his children's "school life" is not compatible with the image Attys. Otis and Lenihan were trying to convey to the Court through their steady stream of malicious lies and bullying.

**The Westford school principal, Mr. Umbro, was called upon to refuse contact with a willing parent who still had half legal custody of his children at the time.**

By the time the Westford school started complaining about the academic progress of the tortured, forcefully medicated and otherwise neglected children, a father's connections have been cut by a public school and his efforts and ability for helping his children were denied.

## The Counseling Center of Nashua, NH

Skillfully fragmenting reality turned crucial when it came to the children's health and mental care. No matter how carefully Ms. Rutland had planned the "coup d'etat", she was forced to improvise when her plot to provoke the Concord school to call DCF fell through (see attached letter). She suddenly faced calling the police herself or postponing. She called 911.

The Concord police did not arrest me despite Ms. Rutland's clear efforts. But this was the third time the police came to our house in the poor children's presence. Obviously, it affected them greatly. Two Massachusetts professionals diagnosed them immediately with PTSD. And both refused to see the children again after hearing my side of the sad story.

Atty. Otis was eager to ride the PTSD "fragment" given an arrest or at least a criminal investigation of father. As neither of those panned out, they had to flip their "reality". With all those lies to the Court already documented, they needed a clean start without the possibility of accountability: Dr. Lawson and Dr. Gallagher in "safe from the Court" NH.

Dr. Lawson specialized in "battered women". She was caring for my son and started by instructing me that she recognized "abusive men" from a mile. With Dr. Deutsch's report in her hand, she dismissed my Inker "delusional" stories and declared my son free of PTSD, ADD or ADHD. She stated flatly that the boy needed therapy because of an "abusive father".

After I finished my analysis of the Deutsch GAL report, finding over 900+ discrepancies, I sent a copy to the center. Dr. Lawson dismissed it as "offensive". She also became protective and I could sense the effects of the alleged professional "brainwashing" on the children soon after. Health insurance by BCBS of MA covered in full the provided services by the center.

That was the time when a "whispering incident" was falsely alleged at the visitation center seemingly in order to allow Dr. Deutsch back again to "professionally" override my 110+ page affidavit with the 900+ documented faults in it. I later signaled to the center that the children felt "alienated". The therapists dismissed the "unfortunate result" of their therapy.

As the trial dragged on with the children's emotional health deteriorating, Atty. Lenihan relayed **the therapists' threat to the Court that they shall refuse treatment for the children if the Court does not strip father's legal custody.** BCBS of MA was still covering the therapy and services for the children suddenly turned into bargaining chips.

I clarified to the doctors in writing that I was cognizant of the ruthless shenanigans committed by the lawyers in Court. The Counseling Center tried to fragment reality once again by attempting to switch Dr. Lawson out. I specifically rejected the new "unnamed" NH doctor now attempting to forcefully medicate my son. I was still maintaining half legal custody.

**The Counseling Center in Nashua NH ignored all my communications and proceeded to forcefully medicate a child by a Dr. Katragadda, with the full acknowledgment of possible liver damage in the boy, in a seeming attempt to collude with the alleged crime by the lawyers and to silence a child who had been intentionally misdiagnosed and mistreated in a seeming interstate health insurance fraud lasting years and causing suffering and distress for the children.**

Dr. Gallagher, Dr. Greenwald, Dr. Katragadda, Dr. Lawson, Mr. Magee, Dr. Tempesta were the staff at the center in NH who had known about the situation, had been monitoring it and received or responded to communications. Just after the trial ended, I specifically withdrew all consent for anyone at the center to treat, evaluate or just touch my children.

As expected, the Court relieved me of my legal responsibility for the healthcare of my children. I shall never agree in clear conscience to allow my children to be maliciously brainwashed, forcefully silenced with stimulants, medically tortured or operated on to provoke churning conflict for lawyers. I had known about the shenanigans and I refused to collude with them.

Having untethered weekly access to 3 Harvard psychiatry professors, i.e. medical doctors trained to consider the "big picture", I discussed with them the seeming ruthless shenanigans by the The Counseling Center. **They unanimously relayed their view that the NH doctors were untrained, unskilled and perhaps biased to deal with the case.**

The professors clearly explained that PTSD and ADHD have similar symptoms but require different treatment. I relayed that information to Dr. Goldsmith, the Concord, MA pediatrician, asking her to bring back the children to MA therapists trained in **accountably** differentiating between the two. She ignored my pleas silencing the child with medication.

The psychiatry professors opined that perhaps "those professionals should not be allowed to treat children". I also asked them for referrals for in-state, skilled and specifically trained doctors and therapists who could be used to help the tortured children. They obliged and I forwarded the information to Ms. Rutland, doctors and all other professionals to no avail.

**I waived my privileges during trial in order to call all the doctors to testify specifically about the PTSD evidences and the wide-ranging, and allegedly criminal, shenanigans of the involved professionals. The Court denied my motion.**

## Supervised visitation centers

I had the "joy" of attending on the average 2 supervised visits with my 4 children every week for 5 years. While I sensed the deep humiliation and horrific stigma that supervised visits meant to a loving father, I treasured these rare opportunities of having a nice and _safe_ time with my children. I started the visits at MSPCC in Lowell with Ms. Gaffny as the director.

Having no agenda, by understanding that I was in this horrible situation for the long haul, I was able to make the best of the visits, nicely rebuilding my lost relationship with my twins and forging a new bond with my little boy and newborn baby girl. I loved every minute of the visits. Ms. Gaffny and Ms. Laureano were professional, protecting and decent people!

We celebrated every holiday and birthday, I was able to have my parents join in, was allowed to take lots of photographs, help the kids with homework and do fun projects with them. I understood the importance of everything being monitored and reported on. I personally wanted that! I was "doing time" just to document child abusing "feminist" shenanigans.

Ms. Gaffny confirmed what pretty much every father would instinctively know: supervised visits, in their current form, were specifically designed to be a most humiliating and cruel tool available for "feminist predators" in their quest to dominate. As my visits reported no issues whatsoever, month after month, the lawyers had to manufacture some sort of conflict.

The "whispering incident" was artificially injected as a venue by Dr. Deutsch to discredit both my court filings and the problem-free supervised visit reports. The Court allowed this fraud to fester and the lawyers, as they could not touch me, took aim at the director. Ms. Gaffny was "thrown under the bus" for creating a nurturing and humanized environment.

While MSPCC was destroyed with our cases, Ms. Gaffny provided emotional insights into the secretive "supervised visitation meetings" by "man-hating feminists": "no men were allowed at the meetings", "the agenda was strictly exclusionary", "nobody escaped supervision", "protocols were designed to maximize humiliation", "like you would imagine a Nazi meeting".

Alternative House in Lowell has the honorable and much respected charter of protecting women. They are undoubtedly needed and their existence is applauded. They also advertise themselves as "protecting children" by providing "supervised visitation services". I "enjoyed" their services on a weekly basis for years with no issues or complaints raised against me.

I quickly learned the forcefully "feminized" behavior patterns they "accepted", and had no difficulty navigating the visits. While I did not complain, Alternative House has direct policies and restrictions that treat fathers as plain lowly criminals or, even worse, raw "male animals". Sure, their "efforts" can be quickly made into convincing PowerPoint presentations.

The intent is clear: no picture taking allowed (erase records of any bonds), no siblings, no family members allowed (no witnesses to said bonds), the same tiny room to visit in for years on end ("dad" is really in "jail"), no limits on terms, no path for "improvement", no checks on custodial parent manipulations, alienation or "using" children, limited celebrations, etc.

The charter is to "protect women": an addicting sounding but predatory agenda providing irrefutable services to lawyers hungry for courtroom conflict. AH allowed the weekly visits to be "canceled by children" for no reason for months on end giving the Court a quick pretext: "supervised visits are not improving". Even Atty. Harris called the nasty "scheme".

Alternative House, by crowding families into a tiny place, also provided a constant disturbing experience: I and my little children were frequently interrupted by the monitors incessantly calling out the "neighboring" fathers about their seemingly never ending, repeated and stereotypically male "faults". They openly shamed, humiliated fathers in front of his children.

**Even the most primitive and ruthless societies know that "you humiliate parents in front of their children, you effectively humiliate and punish the children".**

## Fairplay and Ms. Julia Brice

I voluntarily ended my visits at AH by simply refusing to continue to expose my children to the "institutionalized" parental alienation, manipulation and torturing waged by the many "feminist" lawyers against my two families. As we were running out of available supervised visitation centers, the Court mandated visits with Ms. Julia Brice and her Fairplay, LLC.

Ms. Brice, the self-described "mother of the Mass. supervised visitation program" is a vocal and proud feminist, a respected professional and a decent person. She started by making me "feel good" with her "outmost hatred for all those lawyers" (I do not hate lawyers). She was the "mop for the judges", tasked with "cleaning up the mess and devastation" by lawyers.

The visits with Ms. Brice were a leap in human quality from the "jail" in Lowell. The sophistication in the treatment (including her weekly "feminist tricks" as mental floss) was refreshing. Considering the circumstances, I will always have a place for Julia in my heart. She allowed me to have some wonderful times with my twins. And I have pictures to prove.

As testament to her humanity and decency, this is my last communication from Ms. Brice: **"I just hugged u cause we needed it! Had no idea i would not see you today!!"**. The Romanian secret police officer, who had beaten me up badly for info I did not have, ran into me on the street just before I left for New York. He wished me good luck and offered to shake hands.

I do not hate, and I do not "eject" painful memories either. I did shake hands with Lieutenant Rusu without regrets, after all he "beat" me into a much better place. I also flat out canceled my visits with Fairplay after it became obvious that Ms. Brice was unfortunately succumbing to the seemingly predatory "feminist" powers of the Deutsch relentless "feeder network".

As the visits were tracking "too good for comfort", conflict had to seemingly be injected and Ms. Brice, perhaps too nice to do it personally, brought in a "apparatchik" who attempted to put the children on the spot. I caught it in time, prevented the twins from having to forcefully choose between their parents, in front of eager predators, and canceled the visits.

**I grew up in the Romanian Ceausescu dictatorship and I had known children whose father "just disappeared". The ruthless aparatchiks' favorite method was asking innocent children about their parents. These nasty tricks are not new, and their use, even by a "nice" woman, is just as fascistic and terror inducing, regardless if used in the name of "protecting mothers" or "protecting workers".**

## Mr. Ryan Donovan: "real son"

Ms. Rutland's first son, Mr. Donovan, was interviewed by Dr. Deutsch. He apparently made malicious statements about the father of his half-siblings to the doctor. Some of those statements are verifiably false and, if Mr. Donovan's account in the GAL report is reliable, they are harmful and damaging to the two children. Mr. Donovan was only 20 at the time.

As per Ms. Rutland's disclosures, Mr. Donovan, her "real son", had a significant Fidelity investments account. The twins did not have that. As the lawsuit was really about millions of dollars of Ms. Rutland's personal funds, Mr. Donovan directly benefitted from a favorable ruling. He trained as a "cook". Currently he seems to be a realtor with no track record.

Respectfully submitted,
