## AI Software To Protect Forcefully Separated American Children

> To: Abigail Johnson, President and CEO, Fidelity Investments,
> and J.J. Allaire, Founder and CEO, RStudio

Dear Respected Technology Leaders,

Please allow my websites mentioned above to introduce me, or more precisely, my story. In this open letter to you, I would like to focus instead on the significant effects your technologically innovative organizations had on me, and on undoubtedly countless software engineer colleagues just like me.

During the early ‘90s, I was consulting as a contract engineer at Fidelity’s FMR division in downtown Boston. I spent years working in a technologically state-of-the-art environment, sometimes directly assisting fund managers and other times answering to traders. It was an inspiring, exciting, and driven place. It was also quite demanding with high-level management’s seemingly keen and caring eye on us.

I was involved in designing and implementing a so-called “Reporting Tool.” After curiously observing the necessarily complicated workflows, I proposed the idea to my managers. Once a “go ahead” had been secured, they seemingly regularly briefed “Abby” about the progress. As a contractor, I was involved only with the technical details and the actual coding. I never had any contact with the visionary then leader of FMR. Upon the project’s completion, it was rolled out to many other departments as well.

The still significantly relevant aspect of the “Reporting Tool” project is that most (80+%) of our managers were women, all capable and skilled professionals. Fidelity’s admirable success is mainly due to its leader’s technologically visionary thinking, organically combined with their then still unique yet effective, value-based execution: women managers “conducting” carefully selected tech contractors.

After I left Fidelity, and as the “internet boom” was starting, I became involved with a fundamentally different, challenging contract. Motivated by limitless possibilities, the suddenly emerging opportunities guided us toward ever-demanding technical work, difficult to solve problems, and a rewarding ending.

My switch to “us” above is critical. Understanding the “secret” in Fidelity’s formula for excellence, I accepted the offer for managerial help from a former Fidelity employee and my future wife. Without her painfully demanding, crucial, yet never technical nor strategic, day-to-day support, I wouldn’t have been able to write the distributed server software that ultimately attracted the Allaire brothers’ interest.

Understanding the delicate, technically-driven balances behind the almost limitless possibilities better than us, the Allaire brothers had already achieved their significant milestone: Allaire, Inc. went public. As dedicated true-technologists, they nevertheless valued our offering, and they bought the two of us.

Returning to my objective, **I would like to thank you for leading such “value-based” Massachusetts organizations**. In my current situation, as it is impossible to prove innocence, remembering the truth of my Fidelity and Allaire days, is what keeps my sanity, focus, and drive to protect my children alive.

Growing up in communism, where women and men were treated unconditionally equal, as “workers,” I have always respected, valued, and fearlessly followed women. I have never felt the need to even think about bullying, controlling, or forcing women in any way. And without the special, true professional guiding women in my life, I could not have written this letter nor any of my software, valued by others.

I have always viewed women and men as complementary to each other. Another Massachusetts institution, the Family Court’s thus proven craving to see mothers and fathers as adversaries, outright competitors, and even stubborn enemies, despite their shared children, can then seem foreign to one.

Considering the value proposition behind the lawyers’ shamelessly profitable business, it becomes obvious why provoking a father first, by bullying the mother to demand his incarceration, is so effective. Just moments later, for the sake of “justice,” the father is invited to confront the mother before the judge.

My objectives have never been about “winning” against a woman nor taking her money. Just recently, the still millionaire mother silently watched as I was ordered handcuffed for not having $255. The same afternoon, and as a Pro Se party at our trial, I still refused to confront the mother of my children. Despite the blatant bullying of the “elite” lawyers standing right next to her, **she has never been my adversary**.

Perhaps there will come a time when the “value proposition” of our Family Courts will be more aligned with our leading and most innovative businesses, like yours. I am working hard on the software to help.

Respectfully,

## Dear Respected AI Technology Investors

“Conflict is opportunity.” Excruciatingly painful conflict, that a loving, but divorcing parent is forced to endure these days must then be the “golden opportunity.” Apparently, it is.

And it also is a ~$50B “Divorce Industry,” exclusively benefitting the lawyers and their “feeder network,” while untouchable for anyone else. But it seems ready to be disrupted. And rolled back up for damages.

I found myself in the middle of the most horrific, paralyzing personal terror while poring over all those “motions,” “reports,” “orders,” etc. My analytical mind tried to calm my unbearable anxiety: “no doubt, it is a problem... and there must be a solution.”

And there is: I call it a “conflict graph.” I mapped a 400 times Harvard “superstar” GAL’s (Guardian ad Litem) maliciously manipulative, massive documents during the absolute darkest days of my life, and I was able to create a 100+ pages-long affidavit with 900+ errors listed. And any of the “errors,” when viewed, could be instantly verified as plain textual inconsistencies.

I am also an entrepreneur, most comfortable with my laptop in my lap, and my servers humming nearby. As a mathematician, I have also been fascinated with “deep learning,” as truly practical, massive optimization, suddenly at our fingertips.

Considering the context of this email, and that the entire Cambridge Family Court is fully intent of silencing me for good, I have no choice but to keep going as fast as I possibly can. State-of-the-art NLP (Natural Language Processing), Harvard Law Caselaw dataset, expertise in generating multi- dimensional reports, and the now in-the-works graphing subsystem will allow me to prove my case in Court, **and to help my children**.

Just a hundred pages of Court orders yielded 1,200+ “errors,” or surely embarrassing purely textual inconsistencies. Slicing the evidence into thematic “quick narratives” (hence qnarre), gave me a short, three pages long quantitative pivot table with intuitive drill-downs for visual verification. In a month or so, the visual “grid” will be joined by a visual “graph” as well.

One needs a “map” through all the “evidence” to win the case, or to refute the malicious allegations. Finding the hyped “fake reporting” is ever elusive. Pointing out quantifiable inconsistencies while visually mapping conflicts, especially in large texts, builds trust and confidence.

I know where to go, I know how to get there, and we have been doing it sustainably, for tightly controlled cost. It is time to scale up, however. Someone will crack this unchartered, virgin market soon. We want to be there first. And we are ready to raise funds.

Thank you in advance. We will be rolling out our new websites soon and our “full stack” **qnarre app** will start to come alive in December. Our role model? Grammarly.com... with graphs and conflict management for everyone.

Respectfully,
