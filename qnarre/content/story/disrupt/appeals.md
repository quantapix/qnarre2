# Appeals Process Has Started

## Motion For Reconsideration

Pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 27, the appellant, “Father” from the underlying complaint for modification, respectfully requests that this Court reconsider the November 18, 2019, decision to deny a stay of the lower court’s judgment. Father's response to the stated guidance of this Court’s decision, i.e., that “he has not demonstrated, as he must, that he has a likelihood of success on the merits of [his] appeal from the June 17, 2019 judgment on the complaint for modification” has four parts, as follows.

### The lower court has not assembled the record

1. Father has filed a timely a) notice of appeal in person, b) motion and affidavit/supplement for indigency, and c) order for the “tapes”.

1. The clerk’s acceptance of all the above and his “all set” confirmation was all Father had received from the lower court until November 7, 2019. When he filed his subsequent appeal, motion for indigency, and order for tapes, the clerk noted that the previous filing had not been “signed by any judge.”

1. Apparently the lower court had to forcefully sentence Father to jail for his stated indigency to be accepted. On November 11, 2019, both the lower court and this Court accepted his indigency applications and the order for tapes was promptly placed and confirmed.

1. As the transcripts are still not available, by no fault of Father’s, his only remedy to comply with this Court’s above noted “must” guidance is to attach his meticulously collected record of the past proceedings.

1. Specifically, while Father still has no transcripts of December 17, 2018, February 20, 2019, (J. Monks), April 24, 2019, June 6, 2019, August 5, 2019, and October 21, 2019, (J. Cafazzo) hearings, copies of the lower court’s rulings are available and now submitted.

1. The parallel cases are extensive, over 60 hearings (15 just recently), 7 judges, 200+ pleadings/filings, and millions of dollars in losses/damages comprise the sad tragedy of the families and the tortured children.

1. Procedural history is included in volumes I and II of the Record Appendix (950 and 567 pages). Impounded volume IV (527) contains police, DCF, two GAL, expert psychiatry, school, and supervised visitation reports.

1. Volume III (564) offers Father’s filed affidavits, including a 100+ pages analysis of the 900+ documented errors committed deliberately by the 400-times MA GAL.

1. “Corruption” volume V contains extensive evidence supporting allegations of sustained, systematic fraud.

1. Volume VI (2,396) presents the available full transcripts of hearings, trials, and all depositions.

1. Volume VII (533) contains pertaining insurance, real-estate, billing, and impounded medical records.

1. The impounded volume VIII (318) collects all filed financial statements by the three parties since 2008.

1. Volume IX presents 166+ emails as Father’s record of his 500+ supervised “waterboarding” visits with his dear children, with no voiced complaints whatsoever.

1. The nine volumes of the Record Appendix have been carefully scanned, prepared, bookmarked as requested by this Court, compressed as much as possible, and split into less than 25MB files. They do not fit into the 35MB prescribed size of the e-file “envelopes”.

1. Permission for extra envelopes has been requested.

### The lower court set a clear, litigated precedent regarding the sequence order of child supports

1. In the guidance of the decision to deny Father’s stay motion, this Court stated, “[he has not demonstrated, as he must,] in particular on the issues stated in paragraphs 10-11 of his motion to stay.”

1. Father’s original paragraph 10 reads, “Set through extensive, years-long litigation, a clear and unambiguous precedent exists in Father’s two active parallel cases when considering the materially significant sequence order of awarded child supports.”

1. The motive and narrative for the “race to court” and the “initial fraud” by the “rich” mother is found. It is also part of a defamation and tort complaint to be filed in the Middlesex Superior Court, supported by the hereby submitted facts and documents.

1. Driven by greed and jealousy, the “rich” mother deliberately initiated the lawsuits, days before the “poor” mother had a chance. Her desperately rushed false “child abuse” pretext, and thus perjured initial affidavit, had to be filed before the arrival of the “new baby”, for child support purposes.

1. No time was wasted in the race to becoming the primary child support recipient. Even a “short order of notice”, and an experienced attorney’s affidavit, was skillfully used to intimidate and outrun a pregnant and inexperienced “poor” mother.

1. As Father was fully aware of the ruthless “power play” for money, he immediately alerted the court on both sides, requesting “equal” consideration for all his 3 (and days later 4) children.

1. The court responded by immediately, on the first hearing, awarding child support to the “poor” mother, for the new baby. Simultaneously, the court also promptly denied child support to the “rich” mother, “w/o prejudice pending trial”.

1. The “rich” mother, forceful and greedy as ever, attempted to further deceive the court by re-arguing the matter while the “poor” mother was busy, taking care of her just arrived daughter.

1. The “rich” mother continued to pressure the court for support money during hearings, and by isolating Father from his twins, 1:667-740, through “routine fatherless domination." Idle child support calculations were also added to her filed financials.

1. Setting a litigated precedent, Father promptly started paying child support to the “poor” mother after the May 25, 2011, hearing. A matching subsequent judgment unambiguously stated, “Father shall continue to pay $342 per week in child support.”

1. The “rich” mother was awarded child support only 3 years later, per the June 30, 2014, judgment, “Beginning the first Friday following the date of this Judgment, and on each Friday thereafter, Father shall pay child support to Mother in the amount of $233.00.”

### The lower court deliberately falsified its own precedent regarding the order of child supports

1. Returning to this Court’s guidance, Father’s paragraph 11 starts with, “The lower court has deliberately falsified its own set prior precedent.”

1. Starting with the very first court-ordered child support payment in 2011, Father had never been late with his dues until he ran out of his funds in 2018. He contacted the court 6 months prior to that.

1. Moreover, J. Donnelly clearly stated, 1:495, “I am nevertheless concerned that there are parallel custody investigations regarding two sets of children with the same father progressing at the same time without any official acknowledgment that both are ongoing.”

1. Despite Father’s deliberately repeated actions to inform about his dire existential hardship absent any granted relief, see “desperately seeking relief”, from the impossibly false allegations, a unilateral increase in support was ordered in this case on February 20, 2019, from $233 to $255.

1. Disregarding its prior set precedent, the informed court chose to accept only the “rich” mother’s false statements, 2:269, deliberately neglecting, with an “I don’t care about that”, the “poor” mother’s case, and even ignoring the DOR involvement, 2:260, and 2:279.

1. A dogmatically projected conviction that Father had been willfully “neglecting and refusing” to pay child support was reaffirmed later.

1. On October 21, 2019, 2:428, the court finalized an August 8, 2019, “secret” order, 3:28, and committed Father to jail for his known inability to pay $2,500.

1. The apparently expected purge not materializing, the amount was quickly reduced to $1,464. Not having even $100, Father was released from jail only after completing the full sentence on November 3, 2019.

1. On August 20, 2019, the probation officer re- calculated the child support for the “poor” mother.

1. Assuming a bullied and degrading minimum wage job for Father, and the herein disputed judgment, 2:394, that prioritizes the “rich” mother with flip-flopping support of $233 or $255, 2:281, the “poor” mother’s support would be reduced from $342 to $37 per child.

### While holding his children hostage, the court has been forcefully silencing a whistle-blower father

1. Returning to this Court’s guidance, Father’s original paragraph 11 continues, A:11, “[The lower court has deliberately falsified its own set prior precedent,] only to cover-up for allowing its ‘trusted’ professionals free reign in committing documented deceit, fraud, extortion, deep character assassination, and malicious, cruel child abuse.”

1. Demanded by the court, the impossible task to prove the negative, i.e., Father having no net worth nor income possible without any relief, has been going on for a now 15 recent hearings, while his owed combined child supports skyrocketed to now $120,000.

1. As Father has repeatedly filed motions to hold the “trusted officers” accountable for their deliberately deceitful and fraudulent conduct, 1:97-198, the court has now prohibited him from filing any more motions.

1. Father’s attempt to file a new complaint for modification to perhaps solve the impasse regarding the in arrears child supports, that has now reached felony territory, was also denied by the court, 2:434.

### Relief Requested

Father respectfully requests that this Court revisit the issue of stay of either the lower court’s judgment or its rejection of a new complaint for modification. Children should not be victims of deliberate impasses.

Respectfully submitted,
