# Lonely path to Supreme Judicial Court

## Affidavit Regarding Atty. Monroe Inker

This is an open affidavit of “Father” and Appellant and it is his published under oath statement simultaneously submitted to Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court, supporting his Motion for Reconsideration and Application for FAR, respectively.

1. Father has personally known Atty. Inker, “the father of modern family law”, as many consider him.

1. Father’s stay motion was denied with the citation of perhaps one of Inker’s hallmark “women’s personal liberty” strategies for willing divorcing mothers.

1. Father genuinely supports women’s right to move as they wish. Inker’s former client, and Father’s ex- wife, moved her son from her first marriage 7 times during the hapless boy’s first 9 years of schooling.

1. She then moved Father’s twins virtually unopposed through 3 schools in 2 states in just over a year.

1. While always on the move, the court never doubted her justifications of “school no good”, “kids mean”.

1. Father personally witnessing the minute details of Inker’s, and Atty. Otis’, behind-the-scenes ruthlessly predatory activities, learned to understand their “weaponized psychology” directed at loving fathers.

1. A suddenly wealthy and willing mother, Father’s ex- wife chased the father of her first son out of the boy’s life using all the “tools of the trade” provided by Inker, including premeditated lying to the police.

1. Once the lonely boy was moved away from his desperate father to NH, the mother quickly stuffed him into a boarding school and headed down to Florida.

1. The ruthless child-predator legacy of Inker does not show up in his extensive record in our divorce law. An army of “trusted professionals" follows his successful shenanigans, as can be seen from Father’s submitted ~7,000 pages, 9 volumes Record Appendix.

1. The “rich” mother, after abandoning her non- biological twins and divorcing her second husband, Father, successfully avoided paying any support for the children by threatening Father with Inker/Otis.

1. Father’s subsequent effort to create a new family for his twins resulted in the ex-wife’s uncontrolled fears of loosing the “Inker game” to the new willing fiancee, perjured by notorious Atty. Foley.

1. The shrewd “rich” mother attempted to torpedo the new relationship by continually bullying, threatening and resorting to “behind-the-scenes” activities.

1. By bullying the “poor” mother in pre-school, she provoked Father’s false arrest on 2009-01-01. On that day she deliberately withheld from DCF an assault on the twins by the “poor” mother, telling Father that she “would get her” with Father’s defense testimony.

1. Just before kindergarten started for the twins, she coached her daughter to report to her teacher about the “poor” mother “put[ting] a knife to her face”. DCF reported on the incident on 2009-09-04.

1. Once the “rich” mother found out that Father was expected to have a second child, her activities amplified in a “desperate race to court.”

1. A playground confrontation between the two mothers, with public accusations of “baby killer” flying around, lead to desperate “grabbing” of moneys.

1. On 2010-12-17, Father was trapped into attending a sudden “volunteer activity” in school, where he was forced to witness his daughter suddenly telling the teacher that the “poor” mother had been beating her older son. At the time the twins had not seen the other mother for months in private setting.

1. The teacher visibly neglected noticing the deliberate comment about the wellbeing of a boy in the next classroom, and the Concord school was later openly accused in court by the “rich” mother with failure to “file reports as mandated reporters.”

1. Just as per the Inker “personal liberty” trick, the immediate forced removal of the children from MA to NH was sought, along with silencing a vocal Father.

1. The “rich” mother’s “safety”, i.e., the “poor” mother having no funds whatsoever for lawyers, as Atty. Foley’s predatory shenanigans were successfully beaten back a year before with the court denying her demand for “legal fees”, came to an end when Father was able to finally sell a shared house and the “poor” mother received half of Father’s $500,000.

1. The “rich” mother jumped into immediate action, she broke up with her “friend” in NH, moved back to Concord, MA, took her apartment off the market on 2011-01-18 and initiated a desperate “cat-and- mouse” game to create an excuse to go to court.

1. Father’s every step was closely monitored, any chance of an “offense” was taken out of proportions, and as the critical arrival of the “new baby” approached, a last school “field trip” day became her target day for the “coup”.

1. The “rich” mother called Father on 2011-03-29, at 9:26, and they talked for 39 minutes. Per the Inker strategy, the lawyers later claimed during the trial that mother and Father “did not communicate”.

1. During the phone call, the “rich” mother's focus was justifying her “Atty. Foley will suck Alessia dry, and I will not pay a penny supporting that whore.”

1. During the children’s field trip, all of the “rich” mother’s promises to Father were falsified.

1. She immediately brought back the notorious Atty. Otis, (Inker was dead by then), lying to the police, and perjuring herself in her opening affidavit, that “I had just been informed by someone else that the Defendant was hitting Leon.”

1. She had been in possession of that illegal, edited audio recording for the prior year and a half. It was concocted by the emotional “poor” mother, and emailed with a clearly jealous and maliciously provoking message just 2 months before the “poor” mother voluntarily signed a marriage license with Father.

1. Father fully expecting the “coup” on 2011-04-28, focused on ensuring that mother would call the police or DCF herself, and not induce the school initiating the calls, as she had manipulated it previously. He sent her a simple text message “Can you come now!!!”

1. Starting on 2011-05-02, mother maliciously spun that message, as “The Defendant has requested that the Plaintiff take custody of the minor children.”

1. Only after the court had been skillfully deceived for 6 months, Inker style, and all the irreversible actions had been put in motion, the truth behind the perjured affidavit statement, “Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is a true and accurate copy of a text message from the Defendant to the Plaintiff,” emerged.

1. During her deposition, the “rich” mother admitted that Father sent 2 text messages on the day of her “coup”. The second read “I didn’t hit Leon this morning. Why did you set me up?” No reasonable person anywhere would take that as “request to take custody.”

1. Virtually every line of that initial affidavit is a lie. The “rich” mother, already purposefully thinking about the Inker-style “women’s personal liberty” legal angle, claimed: “I have recently moved to the State of New Hampshire; however, I continue to have a condominium in Concord, MA which is for sale.”

1. She had been a) living in Concord MA for the prior 4 months, b) telling that the children every day, c) going to school to “work” the already compromised teacher, and d) she had explicitly taken her apartment off the market, meaning that it was not for sale.

1. Father had no intention to fall into the clear Inker-style “litigation” trap, waiting for all loving fathers in our Family Courts. He followed the children to NH, and then back to MA in less than a year.

1. The “rich” mother purposefully violated another agreement that she had made with Father. She submitted to the court the never signed affidavit she had extorted from Father in exchange for filing ROs against the “poor” mother, and disarming Atty. Foley.

1. The RO hearing was initiated by Atty. Foley, in true Inker-style, deceiving the Family Court while starting a complaint. As expected, Foley never even showed up, leaving her client to admit, “At one point in the New Years episode, his kids were spitting and spitting at me which he thought was hilarious and I didn't and toward the end I did spit once at each of them briefly and that was it.”

1. Seeing how the proceedings progressed, Father had no illusions regarding his chances in Family Court.

1. The “poor” mother’s alleged “child abuse” was then deliberately reinforced by a never corroborated GAL investigation, maliciously coached by the “rich” mother. Their intent was made clear.

1. Falling into the established manipulative pattern, i.e., “waterboarded” children suddenly volunteering to destroy anyone, without a single word in defense allowed from the court, is exactly the “weaponized psychology” that Inker’s success rests on. No wonder communist tyrannies use the same principles as well.

1. This affidavit, and the extensively documented cases behind it, points to a missing link in the Inker-based divorce laws: while protecting women from men is now trivial, how does it protect women from women? More specifically, mothers from mothers?

1. Protecting women from men in court is lucrative and very easy. When it comes to protecting a “poor” mother from a shrewd and manipulative “rich” mother, with “million-dollar” child predator lawyers knowingly lying in court for her, justice becomes really hard.
  
Respectfully submitted,

## Application For Further Appellate Review

### Request For Leave To Obtain Further Appellate Review

Pursuant to Mass. R. App. P. 27.1, the Appellant, or “Father” from the underlying complaint for modification, respectfully requests that this Court grant further appellate review of the Appeals Court’s November 18, 2019, decision to deny stay in this case.

1. Father states that further appellate review is necessitated by substantial reasons affecting the public interest, specifically the wellbeing and care of systematically and institutionally abused (parental alienation) children, and the interests of justice.

1. The lower court’s judgment to a) fraudulently deny Father any connections with his children in an open- ended manner, and b) knowingly perpetuate a child support related stalemate between a secondary, millionaire, and a primary, “needing government aid”, mother can hardly be justice or in public interest.

1. The four children have now been deprived of a skyrocketing ~$120,000 of child support/expenses/ insurance in arrears. The lower court’s deliberate resistance and denial of providing any relief or resolution through 15+ recent hearings is a blatant proof of sustained, systematic and sinister cover-up.

### Statement Of Prior Proceedings

1. Prosecution of Father’s interconnected cases about his 2 sets of 2 children has always been simultaneous.

1. Initial complaints were separately filed by the two mothers in May of 2011. A combined 45+ hearings and 9 days of parallel trials yielded two judgments in 2014.

1. By unambiguously awarding child support for the “poor” mother 3 years before the “rich” mother, the lower court established a clear precedent. See “Motion for Reconsideration” to the Appeals Court.

1. Father repeatedly filed motions and affidavits, desperately pointing to documented child-abusive fraud, devastating deception, suborned and damaging perjury, sustained emotional harm and material injury.

1. Father had voiced his intention to appeal wrongful judgments. The lower court deliberately timed the parallel, interconnected judgments so that Father’s any combination of appeal efforts would have put him into a “Sophie’s choice” scenario: either one or the other mother would have been fully blamed, had any of the possible appeals succeeded. Which set of his dear abused children should have Father chosen?

1. In an effort to protect the victimized mothers of his children, Father deliberately chose to wait out the 3 years until the statutes of limitations expired.

1. 3 years after the last judgment, Father contacted the court and subsequently restarted the current stream of now 15+ hearings in the lower court.

1. From the first hearing on February 2, 2018, Father has consistently requested relief “pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure” from the prior wrongful judgments on the grounds of “fraud, subornation of perjury, misrepresentation, extortion, withholding of evidence, obstruction of justice, etc.”

1. The lower court, through a sequence of now five different judges, has repeatedly ignored, blocked, deflected, denied and prohibited his desperate request for relief, cynically citing that the one year limitation of granting relief, even due to misconduct of “trusted officers” of the courts, has long expired.

1. Father’s denied ability to secure income, support his children, have any meaningful relationship with his children, and simply continue to exist, without being thrown into jail for wanting to equally provide for all of his children, however, is not expiring.

### Statement Of Facts

#### Initial fraud to prevent child support payments

1. The root cause of the endless lawsuits was the “rich” mother’s communicated, jealous and deliberate intention to avoid paying any child support to Father, and thus, somehow, to the “poor” mother. Father had been the physical custodian of his little twins at the time, with the non-biological, millionaire mother not providing any financial support whatsoever.

1. A army of an initial 21, and now 28, attorneys “touched” the cases in some way, churning through an estimated ~$1.2M in “legal expenses”, and causing a now estimated ~$7.1M in realized injury, harm, damages and losses. A defamation and tort complaint is soon to be filed in the Middlesex Superior Court, supported by the hereby submitted facts and documents.

#### Flawed, biased and incomplete GAL reports

1. In a deliberate attempt to obstruct and cover-up the “rich” mother’s initial fraud of lying to the police, DCF, teachers, doctors, therapists, and her suborned perjury in the lower court, a 400-times “superstar” GAL, and then Harvard Medical School psychology professor, submitted maliciously flawed, biased and incomplete GAL reports to the lower court.

1. Father filed a 100+ pages affidavit documenting over 900+ deliberate GAL “errors.” See reports and supporting prior facts and documentation in the e-filed Record Appendix.

1. The lower court’s deliberate actions to silently bury Father’s analysis of seemingly routine predatory, or “high-conflict”, GAL investigations in family courts apparently caused some confusion, ruthlessly child abusive disarray and punitive measures.

#### Sustained and systematic child abuse

1. The lower court judges knowingly stood by a) the forced, out-of-state brainwashing and inappropriate medicating of children suffering from diagnosed PTSD, repeated uprooting and upheavals, b) painful and unnecessary (cancer) surgery of a child, paid with apparently fraudulent health insurance funds, c) the endless, child-torturing stream of supervised visits, subsidized by the state, with a single “waterboarding” agenda: somehow catch fathers with some mistakes, and d) deliberate, documented child abuse, i.e. “fathers are toxic” type of parental alienation, by our public schools.

1. Father’s record of his endured, no complaints voiced, 500+ supervised “waterboarding” visits with his four children is also in the “Record Appendix”.

#### Father’s defamation and professional destruction

1. Father’s attached affidavit documents accepted, “Inker-style” practices in the lower court that lead to an extensive public record of existentially damaging allegations regarding Father’s person, personality, mental health, professional abilities and his publicized, “officially expressed” connection to his loved ones.

1. As Father has publicized his existential hardship of surviving with this impossible burden, the question becomes “can this be proven?”

1. Taking two representative documents, the lower court’s 2 judgments of 2014 and the court’s statement, “parallel custody investigations regarding two sets of children with the same father progressing at the same time without any official acknowledgment” similarity would be expected.

1. A purely textual, i.e. common sense, analysis, encapsulated in a verifiable, fact-based context, gives us ~1,200 errors.

### Further Appellate Review Is Sought For

1. Whether the Appeals Court erred in denying a stay by concluding that Father “has not demonstrated, as he must, that he has a likelihood of success on the merits of [his] appeal from the June 17, 2019 judgment on the complaint for modification.”

1. Father is also filing the above mentioned “Motion for Reconsideration”, along with a set of 9 volumes of Record Appendices, to promptly address the second part of the denial guidance, “in particular on the issues stated in paragraphs 10-11 of his motion to stay.”

1. The cited Cartledge v. Leons, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 579 (2006) specifically contains a clear appellate position statement, “we do not substitute our judgment of the evidence for the subsidiary findings of the judge absent clear error or a 'firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.’"

1. Therefore, Father is seeking further appellate review of the documented and apparently deliberately committed chain of judicial errors that lead to the denied stay. While “trusted officers” of the lower court enjoy a “quick pass” on predatory shenanigans, the harm, injury and damages, that Father and his families continue to endure, seemingly never expire.

### Reasons For Further Appellate Review

#### The Appeals Court Decision Raises Significant Issues Of Public Concern

1. The above mentioned ~1,200 discrepancies between two judgments, that should be somewhat identical, is the result of an analysis that can be mechanized, and given adequate computing resources, can be scaled up.

1. The volume of that discrepancy, combined with the massive size of the cases, the horrific damage they created, the total lack of even a hint of resolution after 15+ recent hearings, and that routinely victimized children’s wellbeing is at stake should bring much needed reflection of what went so wrong.

#### The Appeals Court Decision Raises Significant Issues Affecting The Interests Of Justice

1. The lack of oversight, questionable morals allowed, and no psychological tests administered encourages the “trusted officers” of the court, e.g. “million-dollar attorneys”, to flat out lie or obstruct things as elementarily human as birthday emails from a father to his dear children.

1. The attorney then bullying the court to order Father into minimum wage, thus ignoring his primary support obligations to his children cannot be justice.

### Conclusion

Father respectfully requests that this Court review the matter by questioning why documented shenanigans of the court’s “trusted officers” should expire quickly, in a year, while the horribly damaging effects of their lying, deceit, and fraud should last forever, impacting the wellbeing of our dear children.

Respectfully submitted
