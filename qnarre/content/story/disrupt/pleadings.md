# Repeated Pleadings For Relief

{@a top}

## Denied Right To Work

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated **Father’s Affidavit** states as follows:

### “Rotten From The Head” - Judge Donnelly

1. Father incorporated his first business in 1992 as a one-developer “software architect” entity. Since then he has only provided his professional services or software through his companies.

2. Mother-B, as a “let go” Fidelity employee with no college degree, provided non-technical yet crucial support for Father’s still one-developer startup during the 1998-99 “dot-com” bubble.

3. Father negotiated a $25M “merger and acquisition” with then Allaire, Inc. in late 1999. As promised, he signed over 40% of his shares to Mother-B just before closing the deal in 2000.

4. Mother-B, was represented by notorious Attys. Monroe Inker and Gail Otis, (“Otis”) during her lengthy, multi-millionaire-vs-“looser” divorce from her first husband peaking in 2001.

5. Father directly witnessed the attorneys’ ruthless child-abusive shenanigans as the “trusted” significant other and constant witness to a little boy’s “I want my Daddy” cries in the dark.

6. Mother-B and Father married in December 2003. Mother-B later initiated this matter under false pretenses and through local attorneys in 2007 when she filed for divorce from Father.

7. Mother-B’s attorneys submitted a materially false financial statement to this Court in 2008.

8. In 2011, she filed a complaint for modification under false pretenses again, back through Otis now, just as her child-abusive pre-meditated attempt to have Father arrested by police failed.

9. Mother-B’s falsely stated and filed finances from 2008 were deceivingly and obstructively used and referenced by Otis throughout 2011 and during the lengthy trial, starting in 2012.

10. Otis knowingly and repeatedly made materially false statements in this Court and knowingly submitted materially false, fraudulent motions, memoranda, affidavits on Mother-B’s behalf.

### Cover-Up Through Using, Abusing Children

1. The ordered 2 GAL investigations, building exclusively on Otis’ false and obstructing claims, ended in “Mother-B either lacks affect or was bullied to abandon her twins” binary verdict.

1. Forced separation of children from one parent, and the ensuing cruel parental alienation, is the sole outcome of such harsh conclusions. GAL’s massively invalidating and deliberately “high-conflict”-fabricating motive resulted in significant damages, material losses and pain.

1. Father filed extensive material proofs of the child-abusive GAL report being “biased, flawed and incomplete”. An update GAL investigation was ordered under false pretenses in revenge.

1. He was labelled dangerous, even mentally “disordered” and “indefinite supervision” with his children resulted. His efforts to shed light on the false, fabricated basis of the malicious GAL opinions were either flatly rejected, outright ignored or simply buried by this Family Court.

1. Systematic and materially significant perjury of Mother-B was suborned knowingly and personally by Otis during trial, primed by the harsh and compromise excluding GAL opinion.

1. Otis intently distracted and continually deceived this Court through her known “win-win” strategy of endlessly provoking fathers with their children’s emotional torturing by mothers.

1. Legal custody was finally wrestled from Father by Otis in order to hide the “feeder network”, the provider’s records of the children’s sustained, systematic emotional and medical abuse.

1. Mother-C’s case, while even the judge contemplating on the total lack of evidence for the younger children’s alleged abuse, was nevertheless built on Mother-B’s fraudulent case.

1. **Working and existence is impossible when documents such as Otis’ attached, fraud- based Pre-Trial Memorandum are allowed to be publicly submitted by Family Courts.**

1. The judgement dated June 30, 2014, was based exclusively on Otis’ maliciously false claims.

### Divorce Law Rigged To Torture Children

1. 3 years later, on June 30, 2017, after the statutes of limitations expired for Mothers’ false statements in Court, Father mailed his publicized letters to the Court requesting immunity.

1. Father’s Renewed Motion for Relief from Judgement on grounds of perjury, fraud, etc. was heard on February 12, 2018 along with 2 other motions. No ruling was communicated since.

1. Otis submitted materially false and obstructing written statements for the February 12, 2018 and August 6, 2018 hearings. She made false verbal statements during the February hearing.

1. She also confirmed in her signed and filed response motions to both hearings the existence of Father’s above “motion for relief” as filed and presented for the February 12, 2018 hearing.

1. Otis falsely claimed in Court on August 6, 2018 that in fact Father’s above motion did not ever exist and only one motion, the immediately denied “permission to publish”, was heard.

1. As a result of Otis’ materially false and obstructing claims in Court, the clerk cancelled the August 6, 2018 hearing and dismissed Father’s all other motions with a “only one motion was heard in February, it was [secretly] denied and there is no basis for a hearing today”.

1. Otis still filed in her response that Father’s “Rule 60(b)(3)” motion “must be denied” as it was not filed within one year of the judgement in question, giving the Court an easy ruling.

1. Five different judges of the Cambridge Family Court have heard Father’s repeated desperate “motion for relief” and have ignored it, dismissed it or mechanically denied it so far.

1. **How can a “fair” and “child protecting” Family Court first make life-altering, parent-alienating faulty judgments, based on predatory professionals’ subornation of perjury and fraud, and then stubbornly refuse to even consider the merits of an investigation?**

1. All the while, the same Family Court has been watching the four victimized children suffer emotionally, and in poverty, for more than a year now and through 13 Court hearings already.

1. Father has regularly, extensively and clearly communicated with both Mothers and the Family Court that his forced financial situation was not sustainable, his employment pre-conditions were made impossible and the Court’s effective intervention was necessary.

1. Despite Father’s regular, vocal and meticulously documented opposition, the Family Court deliberately chose to systematically allow “trusted” professionals to continue with a) making maliciously false allegations and then b) multiplying and festering their vicious and abusive Court fabrications. Passive, unquestioning assistance in character assassinations of this scale/intensity by a Family Court carry significant financial consequences and truly harm children.

### Pattern Of Shady Practices Continues

1. On December 17, 2018, Otis deceivingly maintained to this Family Court that “nothing has changed”, and Father’s timely complaint for modification should be immediately dismissed.

1. Otis made her statements despite knowing that a) Father had not been able to pay any child support for a year and b) the children have not had contact with their Father for years already.

1. Father has attempted to submit versions of his Partial Affidavit, with the final dated August 6, 2018, during every hearing. The Court finally accepted the affidavit on February 20, 2019.

1. During that hearing Father also personally handed this Court (J. Monks) his:

- collection of all his previously filed affidavits (52 pages), and
- simultaneously filed “facts” requested for trial conclusion by the Court (20 pages).

1. Otis’ damaging latest false statements to the Court are summarized in the hereby attached Affidavit On False Allegations, expanding on Father’s prior list of the attorneys’ shenanigans.

### Financially Impossible Reality

1. The new Attys. Xavier and Rehmer (“Xavier”) started by immediately deceiving the Court that Father had been in long-term “hidden” contempt for support, despite all the hearings.

1. Xavier knowingly and conveniently withheld material evidence from the Court regarding Father’s dire finances, specifically the fact that he owed not ~$10K, but now an impossible ~$100K in child support that MA taxpayers have already started to pay for Father’s children.

1. Xavier’s successful objective was to mislead the Court into ordering Father to “flip burgers”, i.e. blindly find a minimum-wage job just enough to pay his child support obligations of a mere $255 to **only Mother-B**, still a certified millionaire and proud cashier at Whole Foods.

1. Xavier has no issues charging ~$500 / hour for wasting hours waiting to maliciously and fraudulently trash, destroy and humiliate a hard-working and loving father. Despite Father’s years-long continued efforts to inform the Family Court about the parallel open cases, and the impossible numeric contradiction and inherent abusive conflict in the orders, this Family Court ordered Father into handcuffs and to **“take a minimum wage job”** on June 6, 2019.

1. While Father has not spared efforts to inform about the numerically conflicting requests by the MA DOR, Child Support Enforcement Div., the Court still chose to directly ignore him.

1. The DOR has thus **suspended all of Father’s driver’s and other licenses** on June 13, 2019.

1. Father’s request to this Court on August 20, 2019, regarding the now physical impossibility of him being able to pay for all of his obligations, requiring at least $100K / year revenue, was ignored and all financial decisions have been postponed until the December 9 trial.

### Desperate Efforts To Support Children

1. Following the Court’s June 6, 2019, direct order, and after a purged jail sentence, Father accepted a 1099 minimum wage ($12 / hour) software consulting contract on June 8, 2019.

1. Father has also immediately restarted paying child support of $104 / week, for each mother, respectively, as per the official Mass. Child Support Guidelines Worksheets. Canceled checks for 8 weeks are his proof of his unconditional supporting commitment to his children.

1. Possessing the necessary ability, advanced training and skills, proven track record, and persistent drive, Father has tirelessly worked to create value for his Quantapix startup, with ~$1M invested so far. See the inherent IP turned into accessible blogs at [qnarre.com](https://qnarre.com).

1. Father’s software development has finally reached a state where he can clearly and verifiably:

- formulate a structural problem regarding how Family Courts allow “trusted” professionals to openly game the system for shameless profits, while leveraging our innocent children,
- point to a workable solution using state-of-the-art AI software to a) “read” Court-filed, signed, and BBO-identified “trusted” pleadings, b) adaptively extract easily verifiable and falsifiable contradictions and conflicts, and c) present the results as numeric grids or visual graphs to profile the Court’s “trusted” professionals with reproducible “credibility” scores,
- outline an investment opportunity to disrupt a shameless ~$50B “Divorce Industry” ruthlessly preying on our children by predatory professionals for astronomical profits.

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to:

- finally consider the harsh, deeply child abusive realities and numeric impossibilities that stem from allowing deceiving, defrauding, and bullying “elite” white men to knowingly and intentionally damage and destroy other men’s “fatherless” children for their unbounded, shameless, and literally “in-the-millions” profits, and
- pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, grant relief from the judgments entered on February 13, 2014, June 30, 2014, September 26, 2018, and June 13, 2019, on the grounds of subornation of perjury, fraud, extortion, misrepresentation, withholding of evidence, obstruction of justice, inadvertence, mistake, excusable neglect or any other reason justifying relief from the judgments.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Merge Conflicting Parallel Cases

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated **Father’s Affidavit** states as follows:

### Child Abusive Initial Fraud

1. Both lawsuits were simultaneously started in May of 2011 in the Cambridge Family Court.

2. Notorious attorneys immediately materialized the initial fraud by filing more maliciously deceiving and viciously damaging false statements, affidavits and testimonies with the Court.

3. A ruthlessly manipulative, cruelly child abusive and severely faulty GAL investigation by Dr. Robin Deutsch, a Harvard psychology professor and 400 times GAL, followed as planned.

4. **The GAL report implicitly implicated and irreversibly victimized both Mothers, as some hapless women “lacking affect” or just plain child abusers worthless to talk to.**

5. The Court (J. Donnelly), reportedly suspicious from the start and vocal about matters being “rotten from the head,” refused Mother-B’s, a non-biological mother who had cruelly abandoned her then 3.5 yo twins, obsessive requests for child support for three full years.

6. Boston’s prestigious attorneys, while bragging about having had extensively worked with the “slick superstar” Dr. Deutsch, and intricately knowing how ruthlessly manipulative her GAL reports were, still engaged in threatening and spinning. Their first attempt to merge the cases to their profiteering advantage is the attached Burns & Levinson Mothers Targeted letter.

7. On September 14, 2011, this Court ordered an effective “merger” by allowing Dr. Deutsch’s “work” to de-facto overrule the far less prestigious Dr. Somers' more realistic GAL report.

8. The Court later buried Father’s meticulously prepared rebuttal to Dr. Deutsch’s “superior” and **fraud-based GAL report** along with Father’s 100+ pages accompanying affidavit documenting 900+ systemic errors. Visualizing the “conflicts” became Father’s product idea.

9. Instead, the Court doubled down on the ruthless fraud by compelling the family to endure Dr. Deutsch and her cohorts once again and allowing her to reinforce her initial GAL report with cruelly child abusive and brutally infantile “Father whispered to children” false allegations.

### Divide And Conquer Strategy

1. As the attempted “merger of the cases” through the ruthless GAL reports failed, the Court’s predatory professionals decided to split and fragment Father instead. While allowing Father to visit for 2 hours/week with his twins, the Court granted 4 hours/week with his younger children. The intended professional trap was clear: he “numerically neglects” his dear twins!

1. Father immediately requested to have his visitation times with his twins doubled. After the Court denying his desperate requests three times, he had no choice but to reduce the 4 hours spent with his younger children to the equal 2 hours/week. The conflicted Court expectedly found Father “not wanting” his dear younger children now in its conflicted 2014 judgment.

1. The monstrous Dr. Deutsch GAL report raised the “possibility” of personality disorders that “could have” affected Father’s parenting ability. Father mounted a vigorous defense against the GAL’s malicious, fraud-based insinuations. He brought in three Harvard Medical School colleagues of Dr. Deutsch’s, with far superior skills and an actual ability to diagnose. The Court expectedly refused even to consider the 3 Harvard medical doctors and professors.

1. The Court thus never mentioned any “mental health”-related provisions in its 2014 judgment.

1. Mother-C’s parallel case dropped even the existence of Dr. Deutsch’s GAL report. Suddenly the professionally insinuated “personality disorders” were not in play anymore. The Court subsequently refused to consider any of Father’s therapists or their expert evaluations.

1. An openly bullied fourth GAL, Dr. Somers, falsely testified during the trial 2 years later that Father’s therapists had continued to deny talking to him. Despite Father waiving his therapist /patient privileges and the GAL refusing to update without a mandate, the Court still resorted to split Father with a fraud-based order to continue “therapy” blindly, with no relief granted.

### “Has Not Pursued Any Appellate Relief”

1. The Court’s seemingly blatant attempt to split Father was the timing of judgments in 2014.

1. The parallel cases started at the same time. The simultaneous, overlapping investigations of the same people were in sync. The trial days kept being delayed for clearly manipulated “interplay.” And even the ending of the trials was such that Father could file his “Defendant’s Proposed Findings of Fact” simultaneously, as attached in Stated Facts Affidavit.

1. As Father was vocal about the fraud allowed in Court, his intentions to appeal were clear.

1. Had Father started an appeal after February 13, 2014, the first judgment, the professionals could have immediately turned on both Mothers just as Dr. Deutsch left the option open in her cruel binary “Mother-B either lacks affect or was bullied to abandon her twins” verdict.

1. Had Father started an appeal after June 30, 2014, the second judgment, the professionals would have immediately accused Father of wanting to destroy one mother over the other, especially considering that a) Dr. Deutsch fraudulently wrote “Mother-C was mean to my brother Sam. She hit Sam. Sam would cry. She hit him in the same places”, and b) starting an appeal after June obviously precludes the possibility of an appeal of a February judgment.

1. Given the seemingly deliberately calculated timing of the judgments, Father, with his priorities being the wellbeing of his children, could not initiate an appeal in either case without endangering one or both mothers. His only choice was to wait three years.

### Supervised “Waterboarding” Of Children

1. Splitting and fragmenting Father continued even after the judgments. Viewing Father as a threat and an “imminent danger” to Dr. Deutsch’s vast activist “feeder network”, Father's connections with his children were targeted. Over time, his Court-mandated supervised visits had to be destroyed just as the attorneys threatened in emails: “... My comments on the documents provided by Ms. Brice were relative to Ms. Rutland's obligations only. I ask that you not send out any more emails as I feel they are disruptive to the visitation process.”

1. As Father had no other alternatives to protect his children from ruthless child abuse (parental alienation), he kept sending the emails, a **total of 166**, essentially logging and recording the events just as they happened and giving everyone a chance to refute Father’s shared diary.

1. Ms. Brice of FairPlay and Alternative House, LLC seemingly coordinated the weekly cruel provocations, by leveraging the four innocent, abused, and tortured children, to somehow trap Father into some stereotypical “fatherly” grave mistake. As the attorneys were primed and ready, any mistake witnessed by the weary supervised visitation monitors would have been enough to trigger instant Court actions. At the end, Father logged **over 500 supervised visits** without giving anyone a chance to file any complaints with the Family Court.

### Court To Ignore, Avoid, Delay And Block

1. Father has been requesting the Court, repeatedly during the recent 13 hearings, to intervene regarding his implicitly denied rights to work. The attorneys’ current complaints are hence not just absurd but also deceiving, as the DOR has been informing since February 19, 2019, that Mother-C needed assistance. The Court’s “I don’t care” response is thus confusing.

1. Mother-B’s attorneys are misleadingly claiming that Father is in contempt for ~$15K and 100% health insurance coverage for his children. The attorneys’ deceitful objective is once again to split Father’s ordinary “one person reality” into legally convenient disjoint pieces.

1. Simple math by the prestigious attorneys would have easily verified that the ~$5,000 / month combined Court-ordered child support, expenses, and health insurance obligations for Father add up now to the staggering **$110,000+ in contempt** (and fast increasing) amount.

1. That is already significantly, in fact, impossibly, more than the Family Court’s fraudulently acknowledged and maliciously attributed yearly salary of $70,000 for a highly skilled Father.

1. Father has repeatedly cited increasing other liabilities in his financial statements. These are caused directly by the Court’s neglect and inaction. If the Court included these in the calculations, along with basic survival expenses for food and shelter, the immediately owed sum, due to the Court’s inaction, blocking, and delay would quickly balloon to **$160,000+**.

1. Father repeatedly filed his request to finally end the Court mandated and deeply child abusive financial fraud regarding his child support amounts and to triple his obligations for his dear children retroactively for the last eight years. The Family Court has ignored Father so far.

1. On January 11, 2019, hearing, the Court (J. Black) attempted to spin Father’s desperate call for the Court’s action and tried to bully Father into saying under oath that he just wanted to “not pay any support.” Father emphatically repeated three times to the judge, “I want to TRIPLE the child support. I want to pay as much as my dear children deserve”.

### Desperate Efforts To Support Children (2)

1. Despite the attorneys’ cruel deceptions and the predatory GALs’ existentially annihilating massive invalidation, Father has committed to supporting all of his children with everything he had. He has been effectively unemployable per the endless malicious harassment and fraudulent public court filings. Yet, he is fully willing, able, eager, and capable of working.

1. Understanding the attorneys’ evil schemes, Father funded his software startup as soon as the lawsuits launched. He paid himself a steady, unrealistically high “to support my children as much as possible” $70K salary from his own already taxed savings and avoided the “#MeToo unemployable” issue as long as he could. By believing in the rule of law, he intended to last until the malicious, false, and fraudulent accusations became discredited by the Court.

1. With all his savings, including his retirement, wholly depleted, the 57 yo Father cannot possibly subsidize the Court’s current, fraud-based child supports any longer. A $70K salary is out-of-reach if the Court intends to continue to avoid relieving Father from the impossible burden of all the past **maliciously false, deeply fraudulent** accusations against his person.

1. During the June 6, 2019, trial, this Court forced Father into handcuffs for not having the fraudulently ordered minimal wage job for Mother-B’s unfair $255 weekly child support.

1. The Court deliberately ignored the often repeated fact that Father had had two parallel cases open from day one and this Family Court’s seemingly non-communicating judges have been competing for a gross **$480** weekly income, to pay two **$255 + $342 = $597** child supports. Can an intractable, child-abusive conflict or deliberate contradiction be any more blatant?

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to merge the open parallel cases and allow one judge to succinctly solve and finally end the deliberate splitting and fragmenting, for shameless and ruthless profit, by the Court’s predatory professionals.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Sustained Fraud-On-The-Court

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated “Plaintiff’s Affidavit” and states as follows:

### Impulsive Divorce And Marital Home

1. Alleging “cruel and abusive treatment”, attorneys filed Mother-B’s fraudulent complaint for an impulsive, on a whim divorce in 2007 in this Court. Father responded with an assented motion to have the said allegation deleted. No other pleadings were filed, no court hearings were scheduled, and no GAL/mediator was called upon throughout the rest of the divorce.

1. Mother-B’s only request for monetary compensation of $1.5M was immediately and unconditionally agreed to by Father. Mother-B’s additional demand to forgo all future child support and childcare expenses for the couple's then 4 yo twins was also granted by Father. This Family Court then assigned full custody of the cruelly **abandoned children** to Father.

1. Mother-B also allegedly falsified the “grade” of the marital home, i.e., public records of the Town of Concord, in 2007. Attorneys, upon due process, submitted false financial statements to this Court reflecting the fraudulently inflated official assessment of the marital home Mother-B voluntarily left behind, with deliberate discrepancies of well over a million dollars.

1. Father's immediate abatement to the Town of Concord was denied; however, the assessment of the house was also promptly restored without notice. **Father was defrauded by, and never reimbursed for, ~$25K** as his paid property taxes jumped from ~$34K in 2007 to ~$58K in 2008 before quietly settling back down to ~$34K in 2009, just a year later.

### False Arrest And Attempted Restraining Orders

1. Mothers’ intractable jealousy conflict resulted in Father’s false arrest by Concord Police in 2009 with a fraudulent “strangling of a pregnant woman” pretext. Police and DCF were lied to while a documented assault on children by Mother-C was knowingly withheld from them.

1. Mother-C pleaded the fifth in response to Father’s arrest. Attorneys, upon due process, full disclosure and almost a year later, still filed a fraudulent application for a restraining order in Court using the “Father was arrested” excuse. The Court immediately dismissed it.

1. Attorneys then filed a fraudulent and impossible complaint for $10,000 / month child support for Mother-C. They knowingly submitted false financial statements and fraudulent exhibits in this Court. This Family Court repeatedly denied the attorneys’ request.

1. Attorneys later **demanded ~$13K for “legal fees and expenses”** and submitted their fraud to collection from a victimized Mother-C, as she had fired her attorneys with an email.

### Fabricated “Rape” And Real-Estate Extortions

1. To equally support all of his children, Father invested $800K of his savings in an equally “shared” (Father put Mother-C’s name on the deed) home in Concord in 2010.

1. Mothers’ intractable jealousy conflict and their incessant child abuse made sharing a home impossible. **Father was defrauded by ~$380K when forced to sell the house** just 11 months later, with such significant material loss and just before the current litigation started.

1. Mother-C then threatened Father with malicious false rape accusations to bully him into sharing his “big” house as well. Father denied putting Mother-C’s name on the deed of the big house. The many GALs later confirmed from both Mothers that **rape did not occur**.

1. The self-described “feminist” attorneys, upon due process and full disclosure, still conveniently, and with complete impunity, sustained the spreading of “RAPE” fabrications amounting to systematically misleading the Court, both verbally and in writing.

### Child Custody And Feminist “Coup”

1. Mothers’ intractable jealousy conflict and Mother-B’s experience fueled existential fear of her own Atty. Inker’s “win-win” feminist legal strategy predictably forced Mother-B into kidnapping the children to New Hampshire, and their custody from Father, through a “coup.”

1. With intimate and intricate prior knowledge of “family” details, attorneys aided in planning and executing the “coup” for astronomical financial rewards. Mothers had to openly lie to Police, DCF, school, doctors, therapists, and this Family Court in writing under oath.

1. Attorneys, upon due process and full disclosure, actively culminated the “coup” by fraudulently and continually misleading the Court, both verbally and in writing, about their prior knowledge, intent, actions, evidence, and facts.

1. **The attorneys’ deeds caused extreme emotional and physical distress and suffering in the children, lead to multiple PTSD diagnoses, sleepwalking, suicidal thoughts, loss of a loved one, etc. in the then seven yo endlessly tortured and professionally abused twins**.

1. Counting on Father’s “cash poor, non-liquid asset rich” state stemming from his own experience fueled existential fear of the personally witnessed Atty. Inker “win-win” legal strategy, the attorneys forced Father into an intractable “financial corner.”

### Predatory Gals And The “Mental Health” Scheme

1. Combining the “show me the man and I’ll find you the crime” tool of terror with “drive him crazy by massively invalidating him” weaponized psychology tactic, attorneys purposefully added Harvard / MGH “high conflict” GALs to their ranks.

1. Father notified the GALs in writing regarding his experiences and knowledge about the attorneys’ “win-win” legal strategy. The GALs still proceeded to submit a viciously false and massively invalidating GAL report to the Family Court.

1. To defend his children and to break out of the “financial corner,” Father was rushed, bullied into dumping his “big” house, **immediately loosing the $1.5M he had paid in good faith to Mother-B for her half just three years before**.

1. Without the instant and substantial cash infusion of $1.5M, his original half of the house, Father would have lost the only chance and opportunity to pay the upfront fees attorneys strictly demanded for deposing the Family Court’s “superstar” GALs, Dr. Deutsch and co.

1. Father’s possibility of questioning the GALs’ “mental health” scheme would have vanished without the depositions and notes.

1. Using the GALs’ depositions and notes, Father successfully compiled his motion to vacate the GALs’ report and submitted it to this Court along with his 110 pages affidavit meticulously documenting 900+ errors in the GALs’ report.

1. The GALs’ Court-submitted report, along with Father’s motions and affidavits, is written proof and evidence of Father’s massive psychological invalidation to cover up the attorney’s ruthless child-abusive fraud on this Court.

### Infantile Whispering Story And The GALS’ Revenge

1. A desperate for his children’s well-being Father, also suddenly with “up for grabs” $1M+ in cash, was lured immediately by attorneys into “magical“ trial-outcomes by the prestigious Burns & Levinson firm for “$1M in fees”. Having worked with the “slick” GALs before, attorneys still saw no need for an expert with equal professional stature to GALs.

1. Father’s and Mothers’ combined billed, and fraud-based, legal expenses reached half a million at this point.

1. Father dismissed attorneys’ siren song for “final solution through a trial” and chose steady improvements instead. He decided to work with medical doctors with skills and expertise way above the level of the GALs. As per “redundancy is safety,” Father sought the simultaneous help and assistance of 3 well-respected Harvard psychiatry professors.

1. The attorneys were swapped as well in Father’s sudden strategy tack. The GALs best chance of neutralizing his moves was to be called back by the Court to directly address, “mop up,” and then summarily reject Father’s “Questioning Dr. Deutsch” motions and affidavit.

1. Attorneys, through Mothers, staged a new “coup,” once again ruthlessly leveraging, cruelly invalidating, and emotionally torturing hapless children. The Family Court, while seemingly suspecting foul play, followed suit regardless while holding the children hostages.

1. Attorneys falsely alleged infantile “whispering” by Father during supervised visits, thus “necessitating” the GALs repeat involvement. This lead to fraudulent legal churning, namely the doubling of GALs’, therapists’ and experts’ “expenses” and numbers, etc.

1. **The GALs’ fraudulent activity and revenge “update” steps further defrauded the family by ~$55,214 in “GAL charges.”** The bills payable to MGH also exhibited numeric discrepancies in the thousands.

1. The Court was seemingly satisfied with the “cover-up” and allowed Father’s “questions” of the GALs to slip silently.

### Family Court Trial And Federal Crimes

1. Encouraged by the Court’s unconditional satisfaction, or inaction, with the latest “coup,” attorneys grew bold and, during the trial, personally and knowingly prompted Mother-B to lie under oath in the millions of dollars about her easily verifiable, e.g. “net worth,” figures.

1. Sensing full inactivity from opposing counsel, attorneys ratcheted up their malicious and fraudulent ways and personally bullied Mother-B into more vicious exaggerations, damaging lies and false accusations against Father.

1. Mothers’ capture by attorneys was thus complete: settling with Father to benefit the tortured children or letting their attorneys go became impossible for them.

1. **Father was defrauded by another $157,288, his “therapy” expenses**, since Mothers, attorneys, and GALs, and accordingly, this Family Court, could, or would, never acknowledge nor accept Father’s deliberately impossible “psychological improvements.”

1. Damaging findings about a 400 times Harvard GAL, along with significant financial perjury and sustained child abuse by Mothers taking care of little children, apparently made the Court unwilling, or incapable, of allowing any further testimonies from experts and professionals in the know, with skills, training, and licenses well above of the GALs.

1. Thus, Father’s request and “offer of proof” to introduce his three long-term Harvard psychiatry professor therapists to the trial, in protection and defense of his children’s well- being, was repeatedly denied by this Court.

1. The Court instead decided to “double down” on Father’s informed and loving efforts and immediately stripped him of his legal custody of his children. The Mothers proceeded then to isolate children from Father and their immediate paternal family completely.

1. The Court fully and knowingly, after 3+ years of dual trials, exposed four little children to the unchecked actions of Mothers characterized by a Harvard child psychiatry professor (Dr. Harrison) as **“very dangerous borderlines, you have no idea what they are capable of.”**

### Court And State-Subsidized Feminist Supervision

1. Despite Father never being charged with any crimes nor diagnosed with any disorders, this Court subsequently ordered him to only supervised visits with his children. No expiration nor any “triggering events,” to allow Father to emerge from a profoundly dehumanizing and utterly humiliating status when considering his four little children, were ever provided.

1. Father hence, continued with supervised visits for two more years weekly with all of his children. He exchanged hundreds of cordial scheduling and other emails with the supervision monitors and coordinators.

1. Father has received no complaints regarding his visits with his four children. He has logged over 500 successful and happy visits overall.

1. Father only initiated the indefinite cancellation of the visits when it became clear, and well documented, that his never-ending supervision had a single “feminist” purpose: somehow catch and trap Farther with something inappropriate and thus usable in Court.

1. Thus, **Father was further defrauded by $56,944 for being ordered to pay for his supervised visits with his children with the clear objective of systematically trapping and catching him somehow with something.**

1. While Father did not run into any problems, he nevertheless witnessed the state-subsidized supervised visitation program openly, obsessively, and aggressively humiliating loving fathers in front of their little children by the “woman protecting” staff.

### Right To Work And Right To Support Children

1. The Court’s inaction in response to the constant flow of the attorneys’ viciously false accusations empowered them to maliciously, and with full impunity, prejudge Father in widely disseminated public Court documents.

1. Starting with the very first perjured affidavit filed against Father, it became evident that he would not be able to sustain the sophisticated, high-standards-requiring, engineering-based employment he had studied so hard.

1. To support his children and to stabilize the money flow while the trials were ongoing, Father funded and started a new company and paid himself a competitive salary, with no concern for the always questioned validity of the malicious accusations.

1. As this Court continued to allow the false and fraudulent allegations against Father to build, it became necessary for him to start to question the inaction. Still funded, his timing-related concerns of his future Court-actions were solely for his children’s well-being.

1. **Father has been thus further defrauded by the attorneys for a) 8+ years worth of “reputable” salary ($350K / year), b) missed appreciation of savings he was bullied into prematurely using up ($572K), c) forced investments during a time when he was incapacitated ($150K) and d) double taxation (~$65K).**

1. The accumulated maliciously false and ruthlessly fraudulent Court documentation against Father has become so overbearing that he cannot even start to consider employment nor the necessary corporate fundraising.

### “Trojan Horses” And Bullied Attorneys

1. This Court tolerated the dual lawsuits to mushroom wildly out-of-control for so long that the count of touched attorneys **now reached 28**. All those “billed hours” rob and victimize the children the Family Court is so intent on “protecting.”

1. Attorneys chaotically churning, and with complete impunity, leads to openly bullying each other. Their fear of each other, of reporting the excesses and against-the-rules activities, forces them to line-up behind the one dominant “cause.”

1. Threatened attorneys tend to abandon their clients intently and to manipulate and act against their clients’ best interests effectively. They may even trap their clients, e.g., lead them into contempt for the dominant “cause.”

1. Such attorneys may not bill all or any of their worked hours to their clients. Nevertheless, caused by their secret, hidden actions, they cost their clients dearly, possibly double the billable hours their “sabotaging” activity took.

1. **Mothers and Father were thus further defrauded by a combined ~$1,265,112 as “legal expenses” for both the attorneys’ fraudulent and criminal actions and for their “sabotaging” hours they worked but not billed.**

1. Tolerating “Trojan horse” attorneys (namely Atty. Harris and Lacivita) only increases chaos, fraud, and ruthless, cruel child abuse in Family Courts.

**WHEREFORE** Father hereby respectfully requests this Honorable Court to order 1) a thorough investigation into the past shenanigans and other fraudulent activity of attorneys and GALs, 2) to enact effective measures to prevent the continuation of the documented fraudulent acts and 3) to rule on the damages suffered by the families, including the children. The sustained, years-long suffering, torturing, and invalidation are not repairable, and what the children emotionally missed and lost due to vicious and malicious activity of the professionals is not replaceable. However, monetary losses and damages can be repaired.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Endured Injuries, Harm And Damages

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated **Father’s Affidavit** states as follows:

1. Father believes and through meticulous, extensive documentation is ready and able to prove that since the date of the two judgments of 2014 there is now a materially significant (of at least a **positive 300%**) inconsistency between the amount of the current child support order and the amount one can derive through a fresh application of the Child Support Guidelines.

2. Father has communicated in writing with Mothers his desire and plans to finally rectify the debilitating child support amount inconsistencies and deficiencies that systematic fraud, subornation of perjury, misrepresentation, etc. had introduced into the prior judgments.

### Endured Personal Injury

1. In response, Father received Mother-B’s Motion To Dismiss on December 14, 2018. In it, Atty. Gail Otis, (“Otis”), as the primary perpetrator of said fraudulent predatory acts in Court, claims that no “change of circumstances has occurred since the date of the last judgment.”

1. She also denies that “modification of the previous judgment is warranted”. She even ruthlessly adds that modification would not be “in the children's best interests.”

1. Otis states: “Father has requested a review of the circumstances surrounding entry of the last judgment.” She then overlooks (“but has not pursued any appellate relief in the interim”) the stated reason for the 3 year delay: protecting the Mothers with expired statutes of limitations.

1. Understanding Otis’ ruthless predatory practices, Father reiterates that arduous, emotionally torturing 3 long years had to pass and **statutes of limitations had to expire** to be safe for the victimized Mothers to revisit and rectify the acts they were forced to, suborned to perform.

1. Otis states, “a complaint must contain factual allegations which, if true, raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” She then shamelessly reiterates her previously filed false statements like “Father requested that the Mother take custody of the minor children”, etc.

1. On December 17, 2018, Otis continued unabated to make false statements to this Court. When Father confronted her, she emailed Father: “The court cannot force me out of the case. I take great pleasure in how much my representation of my client aggravates you”.

### Endured Emotional Harm

1. Otis further states that “change in circumstances must be of sufficient magnitude [so that change in visitation] will be conducive to the welfare of the [children]”. She continues, “the Court established that the Father had... canceled his visits with the minor children at the Alternative House” by “citing his frustration with the canceled visits.”

1. Then Otis continues: “he has not alleged the Mother is remotely responsible for the current situation” and “[he] provides no indication that the absence of parenting time is because of any action by the Mother.” Otis’ seemingly expected and accepted stance raises the question: **is parenting a “zero-sum game” in the eyes of the Family Court**? Meaning that: is it necessary for the parents of children to entirely eliminate each other for the Court to notice?

1. Atty. Xavier, (“Xavier”), reiterates the Court’s “finding” that Father canceled supervised visits at Alternative House on November 6, 2013. While him having received the actual filed cancellation letter from Father, Xavier withheld it, deliberately deceiving the Court again.

1. On November 3, 2013, Father specifically wrote to Alternative House: “... As I have not been able to have a full 2-hour visit with [children] since last April, I feel that they themselves have been chronically exposed to the extreme and concerted warfare the mothers and their attorneys have waged against their children’s father. Continuing the visitations would only expose the children to even more indirect humiliation, confusion, pain, and suffering...”

1. After **more than 500 supervised visits** with his children, with no complaints voiced in his record whatsoever, Father further characterized the seemingly activist practice as follows:

1. On July 17, 2017, Father wrote to the Police, DCF, DAs and FBI: Alternative House, by crowding families into a tiny place, also provided a constant disturbing experience: my little children and I were frequently interrupted by the monitors incessantly calling out the “neighboring” fathers about their seemingly never-ending, repeated and stereotypically male “faults”. They openly shamed, humiliated fathers in front of his children. Even the most primitive and ruthless societies know that **“you humiliate parents in front of their children, you effectively humiliate and punish the children.”**

1. Continuing with his strategy to selectively deceive the Court, Xavier purposefully dropped the fact that Father canceled supervised visitation once again, with Ms. Julia Brice, in 2016.

1. During the December 17, 2018 hearing, Father explained to the Court that, while he firmly believes that Ms. Brice is a fundamentally kind and caring person, she nevertheless was forced to succumb to the extreme pressure the attorneys and perhaps Dr. Deutsch put on her.

1. Ms. Brice, after refusing to “waterboard” the children herself, but allowing a hired clueless “apparatchik” to do it, confirmed to Father that she would not be able to continue with monitoring the visits. Understanding the consequences, Father indefinitely canceled then.

1. Father canceled his supervised visits by Ms. Brice in September 2016 and wrote to the Court (J. Donnelly) just as soon as Mothers’ statutes of limitations had expired on June 30, 2017.

1. Father could not have foreseen that the Family Court would flatly ignore, avoid, and even block his written alerts, reports and efforts regarding federal crimes (subornation of perjury) and systematic, sustained child abuse (even across state lines) occurring on its premises.

1. **Father never imagined he would still not have any contact with his loved ones by now.**

1. On December 17, 2018, Otis falsely claimed to this Court that “Father talks to his children every other night.” Nevertheless, she had been part of months-long email chains about how the children were being forced to call Father back only to tell him, “don’t want to talk.”

1. While this sustained child abuse, specifically of compelling a child to do something he/she repeatedly denies of wanting to do, follows the letter of this Court’s order regarding phone calls, it certainly is in contempt with the spirit of that order. The attorney nevertheless kept deceiving the Court, orally, and in writing, claiming “no material changes having occurred.”

### Endured Material Damages

1. Father has regularly, extensively, and clearly communicated with both Mothers and the Family Court that his forced financial situation was not sustainable, his employment pre-conditions were made impossible, and the Court’s effective intervention was necessary.

1. Father’s attached and filed 48 pages “Partial Affidavit” (dated August 6, 2018) states:

 - while exposing four young children to sustained, systematic, ruthless abuse and torturing, it was often stated during the two parallel trials that “these were only about financials,”
 - before the expected lawsuits, Father voluntarily provided exclusive full financial support for his twins (Mother-B) and voluntarily gifted $248,698 to Mother-C as lump sum “child support” for his younger children,
 - since the lawsuits started, Father has never missed a payment for any of his children, them benefiting as follows: Total [child support] paid: **$217,163**,
 - the Court awarding the willing, able and eager to provide Father’s children a combined total of $217,163 over 7+ years came at the following staggering losses for Father and his dependent family: Total [family] losses: **$6,384,151**,
 - the Court, openly bullied and blatantly deceived and defrauded by “trusted” professionals, ignored to consider the most trivial cost/benefit ratio of the “legal” activities and knowingly allowed the direct and sustained damaging of innocent, defenseless children by the ruthlessly profiting “professional” child predators.

1. Despite Father’s regular, vocal, and meticulously documented opposition, the Family Court deliberately and systematically chose to allow “trusted” professionals to continue with a) making maliciously false allegations and then b) multiplying and festering their vicious and abusive Court fabrications. Passive, unquestioning assistance in character assassinations of this scale/intensity by a Court carry significant financial consequences and harm children.

1. While unwilling to doubt the deeply child abusive and seemingly ideological fabrications of the “trusted feminist” professionals, the Court, through Father’s over 10 consistently repeated financial-statement-filings, continually accepted his forced net “self-income” of $902/week.

1. The Court also ordered a) simultaneous child support payments of $342 and $233, b) child expenses payments of ~$230, and c) concomitant supervised visitation fees of $210 and $110 (all amounts per week). Thus the total of ordered payments is $1,125 from an undisputed income of $902. The Family Court’s intention is therefore clear: **forcefully drive the father away from his children** by making any connection financially (i.e., numerically) impossible.

1. Father is willing, able, and capable of applying his advanced education, training, and up-to-date skills to maintain an income of around $400K a year. It is thus unethical and unlawful for him to apply for unemployment assistance or engage in outright welfare abuse.

1. The Court’s “trusted” professional predators knowingly and intentionally sowed “fear, uncertainty and doubt” (FUD) regarding Father’s personal and professional conduct. Until the Court clearly and unequivocally removes such never verified FUD, Father will continue to be unable to secure any income or provide any support for his now impoverished children.

1. As a disciplined, caring, and never violent software engineer, Father started Quantapix, Inc. immediately after the Court-actions were maliciously and fraudulently initiated. Through meticulously documented steps, he self-funded a realistic, steady, and competitive salary (relative to the malicious, never verified allegations and vicious fabrications) of $70K a year.

1. Father consistently paid all his legal, Court-ordered obligations like child support, child expenses, visitation fees, health insurance, taxes, etc. from his salary **and** his savings.

1. At the same time, he tirelessly applied his skills to create non-trivial IP for his company. The company has not been able to generate any income since inception as the extensive and never verified Court-filings against him provide a severely damaging information trail that could not be disclosed nor satisfactorily explained without an explicit statement from the Court.

1. The Court’s latest order of August 20, 2019, states, “This Court requires evidence on the issues of income (including attribution) to enter further orders relative to child support, including whether the orders should be retroactively applied.” and “Plaintiff has not demonstrated... injury, harm or damage...”.

1. The Court has also already issued orders explicitly “valuing” Atty. Xavier’s, as in a skilled professional’s, duly spent time in the context of these cases. Father is a white, middle-aged male of European descent, exactly just like Xavier, with perhaps twice his education level, twice his proven income-generating capacity and with a set of skills in vastly superior demand (“full-stack” software engineer vs. lawyer, see https://www.levels.fyi/charts.html).

1. Father believes, therefore, that the Court’s rules for attributing income/payment for services, or equally, for assessing realized damages due to proven fraud, should uniformly apply.

1. Xavier and his cohorts, Attys. Otis, Rehmer and Ronan, have been systematically deceiving, lying, bullying, threatening, harassing, injuring, harming and damaging the children and Father since the hearing on December 17, 2018. Their malicious actions and the countless demeaning, dehumanizing, and invalidating public Court hearings resulted in Father's denied ability to earn a salary. Or to collect an earnest, merit-based income warranted by his advanced education, publicized skills, demonstrated expertise, and proven track record.

1. In Father’s repeatedly filed motions, he has been quoting a conservative “software engineer / architect” salary of ~$350K per year for himself. The sustained and systematic fraud committed by the Court’s “trusted” professionals has directly denied that from him as a result. Considering the status quo, with an open Court appeal and a second, upcoming trial in just a couple of months, he has no choice but to conclude that he is not employable currently by any outside firm. Father has also emailed several hundreds of relevant leads, offering his professional services. Their understandable reluctance to respond in any manner, especially at the ~$100K+ revenue level recently demanded by the Court, is not helping either.

1. As Father firmly maintains his innocence, his only choice is to consider comparable 1099 contract work, something that he has done through his professional career starting in 1992.

1. Computing the cost of a $350K salary to Father’s company (see attached Labor Cost), one arrives at a required ~$500K yearly revenue for the company, or specifically, a ~$250 per hour 1099-based billable rate to Quantapix (2,000 worked hours are assumed per year).

1. Following the pattern of Xavier’s signed, filed and Court-accepted affidavits regarding his rendered professional services, and conservatively simplifying Father’s actual 65+ worked hours per week to the standard 40, one arrives at a 40 x $250 = $10,000 billed revenue/week.

1. As the children and Father have been ruthlessly subjected to sustained injury, harm, and damages most recently since the December 17, 2018, Court hearing (Father’s hereby renewed other motions cover the previous periods), that gives one ~42 weeks so far.

1. ~42 weeks x $10,000 per week denied revenue = **~$420,000 current, realized, and significant material damages** directly due to systematic and sustained fraud in Court by the “trusted” professionals, specifically Attys. Otis, Xavier, Rehmer, and Ronan.

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to **urgently** consider and to rule to initiate financial reparations for Father’s systematically defrauded and ruthlessly tortured innocent children, for Father and for two endlessly victimized Mothers. Specifically, Father request to have his professional credibility and manly, fatherly honor immediately and officially restored, and his fraud-based child support amounts retroactively tripled.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Stop Sustained, Systematic And Institutionalized Child Abuse (Parental Alienation)

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated “Plaintiff’s Affidavit” states as follows:

### Threats And Summary Execution

1. Father’s motions for a) Relief from Judgement (on the grounds of alleged subornation of perjury, fraud, misrepresentation, extortion, withholding of evidence, obstruction of justice, etc.), b) Permission to Publish and c) Third Motion to End the “Hostage Crisis” were all heard by this Family Court on February 12, 2018.

2. On February 14, 2018, as the result of Father’s mailed hearing notices, the Lowell District Court extended a Harassment Prevention Order, (“HPO”), against Father in a seemingly communist-style “summary execution” fashion (see “16-Summary Execution”).

3. Allegedly a Westford Police Officer, a public school counsel, and the Westford Schools Superintendent himself urged the elementary school teacher to file the HPO against Father all by herself, without legal representation.

4. By concomitantly sending “no trespass” notices and threatening with immediate police action, the Westford and the Concord Public Schools Superintendents concertedly criminalized Father’s public and peaceful efforts to turn to our Courts to resolve the massive and fraudulent “child custody” lawsuits, costing millions of dollars.

### Forced Separation Of Children

1. Father respects and believes in our Courts and our Laws. He has no weapons, has no “destructive” thoughts nor of weapons, has no criminal record, has not committed violence, has not threatened nor bullied, nor abused anyone. Father is not depressed, is not on any medication, does not use drugs nor alcohol. He has not been “diagnosed.”

1. Father has excellent and in high-demand, skills, and job prospects. He is fully capable of earning a living and of concomitantly supporting all of his duties for his children as an unconditionally loving and dedicated father.

1. Despite his years-long genuine efforts to maintain a caring and loving relationship with his children, **the children have been forced to cut ALL physical, verbal, emotional, social, etc. ties with their Father and their paternal family. The two sets of half-siblings have also been completely isolated from each other**.

1. Father alleges that sustained, systematic and institutionalized child abuse (parental alienation) involving many seemingly “activist” professionals and institutions, (“feeder network”), across state boundaries is still ongoing.

1. In light of the school tragedies and “mental health epidemic” consuming our nation, and to protect his children and their parents, Father submits this motion and offers his documents for investigation once again to the FBI.

1. Moreover, Father has invested significant effort and his savings into his software startup. Years of intense work resulted in a “deep neural network” product for quickly extracting verified narratives from vast natural language databases. Father intends to help to protect our children from professional predators with innovative technology.

### Sustained Fraud On The Family Court

1. Father alleges that “trusted professionals” **continue to engage in their “fraud on the Court” schemes** while hiding behind false “protecting women and children” rhetorics and maliciously carrying on with child abuse.

1. As recently as this summer, the Court continued to allow the attorneys to prey on the suffering children and to freely spread lies, misinformation, and outright malicious statements, both verbal and in writing, about Father.

1. Seemingly no attempt has been made to-date to verify nor to restrain any of the attorneys’ list of false, malicious, and/or fraudulent, verbal, and written statements they knowingly and directly made to the Family Court.

### Medical Torturing Of Children

1. Numerous allegations concerning the children’s health, wellbeing, and medical care were officially either fully adopted (plaintiffs) or outright disregarded without verification (defendant) during the last 8+ years of lawsuits.

1. The systematic lack of checks and balances and the seemingly mob-like, “the most threatening lawyer wins” atmosphere leads the otherwise possibly dedicated doctors to be a) quickly bullied by the lawyers into a “will not go to Court, will not go to Court” frenzy and b) forced promptly into knowingly and purposefully hurting the children in their care.

1. Drs. Goldsmith and Kurens, MDs from Atrius Health Concord, openly disregarded, actively dismissed, and maliciously ridiculed Father’s, a legal custodian at the time, earnest efforts to care for and to help his children.

1. The doctors seemingly **conspired with the “army” of local and out-of-state psychologists to conceal the continued medical and emotional abuse of children** used as strategic leverage in the alleged fraud in Court.

1. Despite the family’s extensive financial resources and a nationally best, Harvard-affiliated medical staff available locally, the Atrius pediatrician continually forced the children to leave the state for medical and “therapy” needs for years on end. Specifically, Dr. Goldsmith stubbornly compelled and watched a struggling child in her care being forcefully medicated into submission in New Hampshire under fraudulent pretenses.

### Ignored Suicidal Thoughts Of Our Children

1. Many psychologists (Drs. Lawson, Gallagher, Tempesta, Katragadda, Magee, and Greenwald) at the Counseling Center of Nashua, NH, actively engaged in seemingly turning a blind eye on the fraudulently manipulative core of the cases. Father’s ongoing efforts for supporting his children were misinterpreted on purpose despite the doctors often receiving updates and invitations for constructive communication.

1. A formal psychological evaluation by the doctors emphasized the seriousness of the situation as **an eight-year-old boy was reportedly complaining about “suicidal thoughts.”** The “inconvenient” truth was later disregarded.

1. The therapists repeatedly dismissed the children’s ongoing troubles during the interviews with Father, denied even the possibility of PTSD in the children, and resorted to wiping the symptoms clean with ADHD medication.

1. The New Hampshire therapists engaged in sustained, systematic and institutionalized child abuse (parental alienation) as they knowingly, intently and with purpose drove the children away, little by little every week, for years on end, from their loving Father. The doctors and their actions, being out-of-state, were also out-of-reach for the Family Court.

### “Elite” Child Predators

1. Insider, or “Family Court-trusted,” psychologists seem to present an even more pronounced lack of checks-and-balances. The 400 times GAL, Dr. Deutsch, a Harvard & MGH branded and shamelessly self-promoting “high-conflict-expert” was allowed by the Court to charge six times as much for her investigations than a more balanced Dr. Somers.

1. When Dr. Deutsch could not find enough “high-conflict” during her and Dr. Olezeski’s GAL investigation, she knowingly manufactured and maliciously injected a ruthlessly designed and endlessly intractable conflict variety into the cases.

1. Steps followed by the GALs were: **a) massively invalidate the parents, b) forcefully separate their children from them, c) set outright impossible objectives before allowing normalization, and d) aggressively “resist” any corrections**.

1. Questioning a Dr. Deutsch GAL in Court is practically impossible. Cases like hers are designed to be “gold mines” or “pension plans” for the lawyers on both sides. The “expert”- respecting, authority-fearing, clueless, but loving and caring parents are quickly forced into an open struggle in Family Court with no end in sight unless their money runs out.

### Vast And Lucrative “Feeder Network”

1. Dr. Deutsch built a vast, self-reinforcing “feeder network” during years of seemingly unchecked “Family Court activity.”

1. A dissenting fellow GAL Dr. Somers, a disagreeing psychiatrist Dr. Goldblatt, a conflicted “best-friend” Dr. Harrison, a questioning expert Dr. Bursztajn, a fed-up supervised visitation monitor Ms. Gaffny, a dedicated NH teacher Ms. Udice, a perhaps naive Atty. Harris, a frightened pediatrician Dr. Goldsmith, etc. can all be skillfully bullied and effectively silenced by a mob of “protecting women and children... by using them” lawyers.

1. Dr. Deutsch is trained and skilled in conflict management. She is also watched and followed as a “teacher” of the same. The elite institutions that employ a Dr. Deutsch pride themselves with quickly and expertly recognizing predators, especially child predators. Their names and symbols are thus officially respected, trusted and feared (e.g., “Harvard,” “MGH”).

1. The GALs prominently and systematically used their institutions’ letterheads to intimidate and suppress dissent. The institutions also issued incomplete and fraudulent billing statements.

1. Dr. Deutsch’s lucrative conflict “manufacturing” is predatory. The helpless children she is tasked to protect as an “elite” GAL are her direct targets. Dr. Deutsch is a calculating, cruel, and ruthless child predator.

1. Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, institutions of the most elite psychologists, **openly failed as a group to recognize a calculating, cruel, and ruthless child predator among themselves**.

### “Inverted” Sexual Assault By Psychologist

1. Dr. Deutsch delegated much of the GAL “investigation” to Dr. Olezeski, a post-doc with no license to practice psychology at the time. Dr. Olezeski never expressed disagreement with any aspects of the joint investigation.

1. Father was compelled by the GALs to submit himself to psychological testing without a court order. Dr. Olezeski administered the test by herself alone. The GALs’ offices were suddenly utterly empty on the day of the test.

1. Dr. Olezeski began the test by explaining to Father that she had been working with “sex addicts” and “sex offenders” before joining Dr. Deutsch. She was unusually “friendly,” “flirty,” and entirely “odd” during the test. The empty offices, the doctor’s improper appearance and her unusual “sexual” behavior and innuendos made Father feel uncomfortable, utterly threatened and in danger regarding his and his children’s wellbeing.

1. Father later learned that Dr. Olezeski did not follow procedural rules, and her administration of the psychological test was flawed. He maintained throughout the trials that the GAL report was “biased, incomplete, and flawed.”

1. After Dr. Olezeski’s deposition, Father realized that **he had been the victim of an “inverted” sexual assault**, concealed as a threatening and life-changing psychological test administered by a hostile perpetrator and child predator.

1. Recalling Dr. Olezeski’s seemingly obsessive interest in perverted sexuality and her willingness to use the topic as an apparent “activist bait” during an uncalled for psychological testing of a loving father concerned only with his children, Dr. Olezeski’s current position as the Yale Director of “Pediatric Gender Program” invokes thoughts of institutionally “castrating young American boys” in Father.

### Health Insurance For Interstate Child Abuse

1. Dr. Deutsch was quoted saying that the children “need to be in very good treatment, not just with psychologists who take the insurance.” None of her therapist recommendations took insurance. None of the Harvard/MGH psychiatrists in the cases took insurance. Only out-of-state (“out-of-touch”) therapists treated the children.

1. Professionals taking insurance are either “not good” or are not in Dr. Deutsch’s “feeder network.” All the therapists at the Counseling Center in Nashua, NH were paid for years by the children’s health insurance provider. When Father withdrew his consent for them treating his children, he notified the BCBS fraud department.

1. The sustained, systematic, and institutionalized child abuse allegations and the potential long-term interstate health insurance fraud, both by the Counseling Center in Nashua NH, were never investigated.

1. The insurance provider regularly sent Father details about the children’s treatment expenses. Father also received written requests to confirm that other insurance policies did not cover the children. After consulting with the two mothers through emails, Father confirmed that the children were only covered by Father’s BCBS policy.

1. Dr. Goldsmith seemingly initiated a “cancer surgery” on Father’s son. The lawyers leveraged Father’s expected and vocal disagreement regarding the “unnecessary” and a “very painful” medical procedure in Court extensively. The attorneys used the cruel “provocation” on purpose to wrestle the legal custody away from Father.

1. The procedure consisted of Father’s son being hospitalized for two days at MGH, and it involved extensive and excruciating “lymph node removal” oncological surgeries on an 8- year-old boy. Undoubtedly, it was expensive.

1. Father continued to receive small expense reports from BCBS. Father never received any expense reports related to Dr. Goldsmith’s unnecessary and painful medical “cancer intervention” on Father’s son by MGH Oncology.

1. If the surgery was legitimately required, **why was it not paid by the children’s “sole” health insurance**? If the circumstances were “manufactured,” and a little child was painfully 8tortured by highly skilled and trained medical doctors only to aid even more “skilled” predators, **why was it not investigated for fraud**?

### Supervised Visits: The Good

1. Dr. Deutsch held off the children from meeting their father for months after they were forcefully taken from him. To start seeing his loved ones, Father unconditionally agreed to supervised visits at Mother-B’s chosen MSPCC.

1. Ms. Gaffny, the director and a truly wonderful and loving person, provided a safe and nurturing environment for Father’s visits. Slowly Father was able to rebuild his cruelly destroyed bonds with his children. The family had a really good time: “we resumed our activities, we celebrated, we did homework, and we played and played.”

1. MSPCC kindly allowed pictures taken: many pictures prove the happy children! That was the time when Father also reconnected with his older children’s Hudson, New Hampshire teachers. The children started to excel in school, as well.

1. Ms. Gaffny warned: “you cannot cross a Dr. Deutsch.” And she also hinted at the nightmarish stories of the Supervised Visitation Program management meetings. Apparently, no men were allowed, and the agenda was to drive the fathers away from their children: “just imagine those early, underground Nazi meetings.”.

1. After Father filed his motion and affidavit questioning Dr. Deutsch, a false (and infantile) “whispering” story was started. Allegedly Father tried to “secretly communicate” to his children that “he would take them back.”

1. It grew into a ruthless fabrication with the objective to compel the Family Court to order Dr. Deutsch back for a second time to “properly mop up” the case just before the trial. Drs. Deutsch and Kivisto repeated a “biased, flawed and incomplete” GAL investigation and convinced the lawyers to take the risk of perjury subornation.

### Supervised Visits: The Ruthless Tool

1. In the process, the lawyers personally and directly attacked and destroyed Ms. Gaffny and shut MSPCC down.

1. Father continued to see his children at Alternative House. By this time, the Westford teachers took over, and the children started faltering. Then Dr. Goldsmith initiated the surgery, and the therapists at the Counseling Center openly threatened in Court that if Father is not stripped of his legal custody, they will abandon caring for the children.

1. Alternative House in Lowell, chartered to “protect women,” used the children they promised to care for to provoke the fathers: **they started to encourage children to cancel visits for months on end with no reason**.

1. The children were driven to the center and, once there, they had to repeatedly confront adults, telling them that they did not want to see their fathers. A classic textbook case of “communist brainwashing” and the most fundamental psychological rule there is: repeat it enough until it becomes a reality.

1. Attorneys claim a “finding” that Father canceled the supervised visits at Alternative House on November 6, 2013. While having received the actual, filed cancellation letter from Father, lawyers withheld it, deceiving the Court once again.

1. On November 3, 2013, Father specifically wrote to Alternative House: “... As I have not been able to have a full 2-hour visit with [children] since last April, I feel that they themselves have been chronically exposed to the extreme and concerted warfare the mothers and their attorneys have waged against their children’s father. Continuing the visitations would only expose the children to even more indirect humiliation, confusion, pain, and suffering...”

1. After **more than 500 supervised visits** with his children, and with no complaints voiced whatsoever, Father canceled supervised visitation once again, with Ms. Brice, in 2016.

1. After refusing to “waterboard” the children, Ms. Brice confirmed to Father that she would not be able to continue with monitoring Father’s visits. Father canceled his supervised visits with Ms. Brice in September 2016, and wrote to the Court as soon as Mothers’ statutes of limitations expired in 2017.

1. Father could not have foreseen that the Family Court would flatly ignore, avoid, and even block his written alerts, reports and efforts regarding subornation of perjury and systematic, sustained child abuse (across state lines) occurring on its premises.

1. **Father never imagined he would still not have any contact with his loved ones by now**.

1. During December 17, 2018, hearing, Father explained to the Court that, while he firmly believes that Ms. Brice is a fundamentally kind and caring person, she nevertheless was forced to succumb to the extreme pressure the attorneys, and perhaps Dr. Deutsch, put on her.

1. Father also communicated to the Court that he was confident that after the cases have been brought back to the Court and after the Dr. Deutsch issue has been publicized, Ms. Brice would not feel pressured and stressed anymore. And that supervised visits with Father’s all four children could be restarted without any further concerns or unnecessary delays.

### Defrauded Family Court

1. The Court allowed the same false, malicious, and fraudulent allegations to be continually repeated through now 60+ hearings while the children were forced to suffer. As no repetitions can alter the already filed documents, the earliest fraud was committed when Mother-B’s financial statement was first filed on March 19, 2008.

1. During the divorce, Mother-B’s every wish for money was satisfied by Father. Only minimal contact with her children was asked of her in return (anything more was always welcomed, accommodated, and awarded by Father!).

1. When Mother-C arrived, and the children started to bond with her, Mother-B focused all her energy and skills to provoke and sabotage the new relationship directly. Mother-C was no match for Mother-B, as she reacted with confusion and panic and quickly turned her anger towards Father and Father’s beloved children.

1. The unrelenting both insinuated, and targeted stress and even public provocations pushed the pregnant and bleeding Mother-C over the edge, and she assaulted Father’s children. Mother-C then panicked and called 911.

1. She lied to the Concord Police that Father “strangled” her. This allegation resulted in Father’s immediate and false arrest. Mother-B’s calculated, malicious response to Father was, “I will put that gold digger, crazy whore in jail with your own defense testimony.” Mother-C’s attorney advised her to plead the fifth in Court immediately.

1. Mother-B attempted to “indirectly” harm Mother-C again when she used her kindergartner child to provoke a DCF call by school (“knife incident”) and her first-grader to trap Ms. Henry (“Alessia beating Steve”).

1. Father signing $250K “child support” over to Mother-C in preparation for the lawsuits alarmed Mother-B. Weeks before Mother-B called the Concord Police on Father with false allegations; she phoned Father with her ultimatum: “Atty. Foley will suck Alessia dry, and I will not pay a penny supporting that whore”.

**WHEREFORE** Father hereby respectfully requests this Honorable Court to order to investigate and evaluate the children’s overall wellbeing, medical and emotional care, past unmitigated trauma and suffered harm, family ties (including their relationships with their parents, siblings, grandparents), social, academic, extracurricular and financial needs and custodial necessities.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Stop Fraudulent And Predatory “Mental Health” Madness

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Plaintiffs, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated “Plaintiff’s Affidavit” states as follows:

### Case Study Of Predatory “Mental Health” Madness

1. Dr. Robin Deutsch, a mere psychologist with no MD license, stated in her GAL report that Father “will not be amenable to mental health treatment” by claiming “possible,” **but never diagnosed**, personality disorders, and she thus mandated “indefinite” supervised visitations.

2. Understanding the severity of this fatherly death sentence, Father had to retain an expert on par with Dr. Deutsch’s 400 times GAL “superstar,” and also notorious, terrorizing and “high-conflict” fame to protect his children from being humiliated into lifelong fatherlessness.

3. Father also had to rely on specialized expertise, with adequate and matching Harvard Medical School stature, to defend his children and himself from the repeatedly threatened further countless “psych experts.” The clearly stated intention was the professionals freely building on Dr. Deutsch’s malicious report and simultaneously “monitoring” forever.

4. Dr. Deutsch partly relied on a 1.5-hour faulty psychological test administered to Father by an unlicensed post-doc, Dr. Olezeski, specializing in adult sex offenders. The post-doc, however, left the state of Massachusetts 2 weeks before Dr. Deutsch filed her GAL report.

5. Psychiatry Prof Dr. Bursztajn, MD of Harvard Medical School, spent over 300 hours personally evaluating, testing, and treating Father both as an expert and as a highly-skilled therapist helping his “devastated patient” to recover from the massive invalidation.

6. His dual, full psychiatry evaluations/reports of Father, considering both Mothers and the overall destructive dynamic among the three parents, conclusively ruled out the “possible,” yet somehow still untreatable (!), personality disorders that Dr. Deutsch had claimed.

7. Dr. Bursztajn wrote in his thoroughly researched recommendations that: **“(1) Father presents no danger to his children; (2) there is no indication of impairment of his fitness to parent”.**

### “Mental Health”: A Feminist Bullying Weapon

1. Mother-B’s expert, Dr. Daigneault, also authored a vicious report about Father without ever contacting him or any of his references. He simply reiterated, literally flat-out copied, Dr. Deutsch’s report, along with its shortcomings and significant malicious factual defects.

1. Another mere psychologist, Dr. Daigneault, also from Harvard Medical School, conveniently “cherry-picked” Father’s deposition as well and blatantly took sentences out of their contexts openly and freely ignoring the thus introduced serious medical inconsistencies and hypocrisy.

1. The expert’s report has been apparently disseminated with impunity to Mother-B, therapists, and schools by the attorneys. It contains a sequence of verbatim “cut and paste” pages of Dr. Deutsch’s viciously damaging, fraudulent, and Family Court-impounded GAL report.

### Defrauding The Court With “Mental Health” Claims

1. Mother-C’s seemingly bullied motion requesting access to Dr. Deutsch’s report by her never identified “new expert” was not allowed, and she silently withdrew her intent to use Dr. Deutsch and the new expert without notice for almost a year.

1. Father’s psychiatry evaluation and report by Dr. Bursztajn was thus denied from evidence during a hearing in this Family Court and, despite Father’s well-founded, repeated requests, was never reintroduced during the trials.

1. Psychiatry Prof. Dr. Harrison, MD, also Father’s long-term therapist, had been Dr. Deutsch’s specific top requirement as an expert child psychiatrist from Harvard Medical School. As also a “best friend,” the GAL accepted her to validate Father’s never defined “triggering events”.

1. As she had not been able to meet the children, apparently on purpose, Dr. Harrison was never called upon to voice her trusted opinion despite her original voluntary agreement to testify in Court equally, about both sets of Father’s children.

1. Mothers never introduced the four children to Dr. Harrison despite explicit agreements and voiced encouragement from all GALs. Father patiently waited for nine months for Mothers’ actions, attending weekly “therapy” sessions with Dr. Harrison.

1. Dr. Harrison diagnosed Father apparently first with “PTSD” (as in “Provoke him To Self-Destruct”), as he started seeing her before Dr. Bursztajn. Later in an email, she expressed her praise and complete agreement with Dr. Bursztajn’s reports regarding Father.

1. **While Dr. Deutsch interviewed Dr. Harrison “extensively,” she still never mentioned her “friend’s” actual medical diagnosis during the trial testimony, despite the then evident courtroom controversy about Dr. Goldblatt, a third therapist, and the topic of PTSD.**

1. Psychiatry Prof Dr. Goldblatt, MD of Harvard Medical School, was Father’s first long-term, “suicide expert” therapist, and while Father saw him weekly for a year, the doctor never diagnosed nor medicated Father in any way.

1. Dr. Goldblatt effectively and successfully treated Father during his deep depression following Dr. Deutsch’s massive invalidation. The devastatingly biased and fraudulent GAL report, forcefully and entirely separating Father’s children from him, literarily hindered him dysfunctional at the time by having a profoundly paralyzing emotional effect on him.

### Therapy Hypocrisy: Just “Shield And Sword”

1. The said controversy during the trial (see extensive explanation in the Court’s Judgment) was about Father’s alleged use of therapy as “both a shield and a sword.” Father has since filed a motion and “offer of proof” to waive all his “preyed-on” therapist/patient privileges.

1. Dr. Deutsch reported that “the lack of affect on Mother-B’s part could be a result of lack of care and concern for the children.” But she chose to unconditionally accept Mother-B’s “being bullied” false allegations and left both Mothers without any practical help.

1. **The “lack of affect” has not been addressed, neither have Mothers been psychologically evaluated, nor treated/healed, despite the sustained extreme suffering and destruction caused by reckless actions and the horrific, long-lasting dual lawsuits.**

**WHEREFORE** Father hereby respectfully requests this Honorable Court to order a thorough investigation into the past shenanigans and other fraudulent activity of the “elite” GALs and other professionals.

Respectfully resubmitted,

## Proposed Resolution By A Loving, Caring And Concerned Father

**NOW COMES** Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and states as follows:

### Full Immunity For Mothers

1. This Honorable Court is to grant unconditional and immediate **full immunity** to both Mothers.

2. Physical custody of Father’s all four children to be left intact for the best interest, continuity and stability of the much abused, tortured and victimized children.

3. Shared legal custody of Father’s all four children to be immediately restored, as Mothers have exhaustively proven in this Family Court of being utterly incapable to protect their children from professional feminist child predators **by themselves alone**.

### Leave Parents Alone Or Do No More Harm

1. After systematically failing to protect the families and the involved children from the army of “Court-trusted” professional feminist child predators, this Honorable Court is to either:

- Fully withdraw from micromanaging the children’s relationship with their parents, or
- Immediately appoint a professionally qualified GAL to investigate **all** documented
aspects of the cases. This Honorable Court thus would also require that the GAL:
   1. has professionally sworn to “do no harm” (i.e. she is an MD and not just a psychologist),
   2. has no outstanding or unresolved “toxic masculinity”-related personal experiences, and
   3. has no personal need to resort to “activism” in her professional line of work from any “feminist”, “LGBTQ” or any other “social injustice”-related “sudden awakenings”.

### Investigate, Relieve And Repair Damages

1. As the families’ documented damages caused by the Family Court’s systematic and sustained negligence and failure in supervising and restraining its “trusted” professionals and “officers” **run into the millions**, this Honorable Family Court is to immediately initiate an investigation with the objective of determining a “reparation” amount for all the damages, harm, suffering and pain caused by intentional wrongful acts by professionals.

1. The families have now provenly depleted all their financial resources. Moreover, Father’s **right to work**, as per his expertise, skills and training, has been knowingly and intentionally kept uncertain and undecided for years on end by the Family Court’s documented acts and judgments. Urgent action and rulings are thus required by this Honorable Family Court to immediately restore the families’ financial solvency, literal existence and the victimized children’s physical and emotional well being.

### Offer For Income For Mothers

1. As per the attached email exhibit dated March 28, 2019, Father also states that

- he desperately needs “specialized” computer time,
- Mother-B seemingly just received $1,000,000+ in cash as a proud “Whole Foods cashier” currently working for a minimal salary and
- Father has the training, skills, expertise and track record to confidently offer Mothers a steady and safe income, literally in multiples of their current salaries, as outlined in the attached email also witnessed by 21 recipients, **and strictly in addition to all normal Court mandated and Father’s unconditionally agreed to child support/expense/ insurance payments**.

Respectfully resubmitted,
