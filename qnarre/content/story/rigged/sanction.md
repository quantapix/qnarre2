# Privileges And Call To Sanction Attorneys

{@a top}

Dear Former Therapists

I need to notify you that I will be waiving my (former) therapist/patient privilege tomorrow as my attorney's motion to withdraw from the case will be heard on an emergency basis. And if I don't get the chance tomorrow then Monday during the trial I certainly will have the opportunity.

I feel that I have no other option as both my attorney/client and therapist/patient privilege is seemingly being used against me and my relationship with my children. Protecting my privileges provides an apparently ample opportunity for the attorneys and GALs to create fear, uncertainty and doubt, as both GALs testified that without knowing what the therapist are saying about me, they continued to have "concerns".

As apparently forceful medicating of my children has started, I feel that it is time for me to stop the unintentional "hiding" behind privileges while my children are being held hostage in this cruel game. I am attaching my affidavit of "extreme legal duress" (w/o exhibits) that I will be filing simultaneously in both courts.

I hope you understand my position and thank you for your time for reading this in advance.

Sincerely,

## Regarding PTSD (Provoke To Self-Destruct) evidence

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, and states as follows:

1. The Plaintiff has filed a "Motion In Limine to Exclude Evidence Regarding PTSD".

2. The motion alleges that "Father is attempting to use his therapeutic treatment as both a shield and a sword by asserting privilege by his recent assertion of this claim in this action. Father should not be permitted to do so."

3. As the Plaintiff is using an allegedly faulty, biased and incomplete GAL investigation by Dr. Deutsch in order to isolate father from children while also seemingly forcing said child on medication to quiet him down, Father has no choice but to relinquish both his attorney/client and therapist/patient privileges in order to somehow protect his child.

4. Father has notified all 4 of his long-term therapists: Prof. Dr. Bursztajn MD, Prof. Dr. Goldblatt MD, Dr. Alexandra Harrison MD and Ms. Dawn Parker MS as indicated in the attached email regarding his choice of waiving his therapist/patient privilege.

**WHEREFORE** the Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court allow the Father's therapists to openly testify about their professional views and opinions in this critical matter.

Respectfully submitted,

## "Offer of proof" filed with the court

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, the "Father" of the directly or indirectly involved 4 children, and states:

### Background

1. Dr. Deutsch was the appointed GAL. Dr. Somers was the appointed GAL in the parallel case.

2. Dr. Deutsch had no mandate to consider Ms. Woburn, "Mother-C", and her effects in the apparent "triangle family" relationship. Dr. Somers had a mandate to consider Ms. Rutland, "Mother-B".

3. Dr. Deutsch filed a seemingly flawed, biased and incomplete GAL report.

4. She apparently neglected to report about Father's account of the then 1.5 year old recording that Mother-C had made without Father's knowledge and emailed to Mother-B. Both mothers had used the recording later to threaten and blackmail Father as it was often expressed.

5. Father submitted his "Defense Support" document to Dr. Deutsch. The document specifically contained the full text of said emails. Dr. Deutsch apparently neglected to connect the text of the emails provided by Father with the copy of the recording provided by Mother-B.

6. Father briefed Dr. Deutsch about the "night before incident" . As per her handwritten notes, she was seemingly aware of the inconsistency. She later chose to ignore it in the GAL report.

7. During said incident Father hit his son, Leon, once on the back of his head with an open palm and without his body moving in an ill conceived effort to discipline him.

8. The incident was witnessed by Father's mother and was also openly confessed and apologized for by Father in front of the police, DCF, magistrate, GAL, therapists, Court, depositions, etc.

9. Leon seemingly never mentioned the incident, as noted by the police, to his "trusted" Mother-B in their immediately following private videophone conversation, during a next morning's field trip with Mother-B in attendance nor after Mother-B's taking of the children in her custody.

10. Dr. Deutsch apparently neglected to consider the consequences of Mother-B not knowing about a witnessed, confessed, apologized for and extensively documented incident directly involving the child and immediately preceding the "child beating and abuse" allegations.

11. She chose to neglect contacting Father's mother, the only adult witness to said incident. Dr. Deutsch apparently fabricated a story about her instead, "in error", as she later testified.

12. The twins being diagnosed with PTSD directly afterwards the custody change, as per Mother-B's deposition, and not seeing Father for 6 months afterwards was also not reported.

13. Father's effort to recontact Dr. Deutsch about the "child beating" inconsistencies (apparent in the then fresh DCF report as well) and the then "just revealed" recording were also ignored.

14. Mother-B handed the DCF report about Lisa & Leon to Mother-C, an alleged "abuser", for her to renew a twice denied attempt at ordering supervised only visitations for Father with his Luke & Lola. Dr. Deutsch ignored this development despite Father's timely email to her.

15. Mother-C's request to "view" Dr. Deutsch's report was allowed. Despite the more relevant Dr. Somers report, her attorney successfully used it to force the years long litigation going.

16. Father's pleading emails to settle sent to Mother-C's attorney fell on deaf ears and were later withheld, against Father's direct requests, from both trial evidence and his testimony.

17. Aided by Monroe Inker, Mother-B accumulated vast expertise during a prior bitter yet very successful custody battle . Despite noting Father's fear about it, Dr. Deutsch unconditionally accepted Mother-B's allegations of her "being bullied into giving up her children".

18. As per the FS filed during his divorce in 2008, his accordingly made $1.5M payment and his financial meltdown losses that year rendered Father's finances significantly weaker than Mother-B's while her further actions erased Father's ability for any investment income.

19. As the children were physically isolated from Father for months, their voices (or lack of) were ignored, his account of the events (including traumatic medical history) was neglected and his references were ignored, Dr. Deutsch's investigation massively invalidated Father.

20. Father thus found him self in an utterly hopeless situation on all fronts just after Dr. Deutsch filed her report. He was deeply depressed, barely functioning and stripped of all dear to him.

### Prof. Dr. Goldblatt, MD of Harvard Medical School

21. Father contacted Dr. Goldblatt as per the advice he had received from Dr. Von Broembsen, also referenced by Dr. Deutsch in her report. Seemingly fittingly, Dr. G specialized in suicide prevention and he was the president of the foundation for suicide prevention.

22. His first remark was that he did not take insurance. The subject was never discussed again.

23. He also indicated that in order for his therapy to be effective he would not testify in court.

24. Considering Father's state at the time, he unconditionally accepted the doctor's terms.

25. Dr. G apparently applied "cognitive behavior therapy" to Father. This meant that Father "safely" talked while the doctor listened. During the sessions Dr. G barely said more than a few sentences. This however, soon streamlined Father's thoughts and the hour therapy had the effect of controlling and monitoring Father's thought processes for the rest of the week.

26. Father learned how to manage his thoughts and slowly became able to start planning on escaping his "hopeless" state. Father's belief that "there was always something good in everything bad" resulted in "uplifting" mental exercises by searching for that "good" .

27. Father became able to find a strategy to somehow sell the big house, despite all the odds and loosing only half its value, in order to pay for Dr. Deutsch's deposition in the nick of time.

28. Father's project for a "memorable" photo album for his children's birthday allowed him to relive life with his children through the thousands of photos without getting lost in the pain.

29. Father's childhood "expertise" of hunting for contradictions in carefully crafted communist propaganda aided him in systematically analyzing Dr. Deutsch's GAL report as he was also grasping the reality of "a father's death sentence" as far as all of his children were concerned.

30. Dr. G's patient and skillful presence helped Father deal with his debilitating stressors in his life: selling the big house, completing the children's photo albums and filing his "Vacate Dr. Deutsch's Report" motion along with the 100+ pages affidavit on his children's birthday.

31. As it became evident that Dr. Deutsch's report would not be used in the Woburn matter after all, Father concluded that he learned all he could from Dr. G and considering the extreme financial burden of three therapists, Father ended therapy with Dr. G on cordial terms.

32. Father attended weekly therapy sessions for a year with Dr. G. The doctor never diagnosed Father, never discussed medication with Father and Father was never prescribed anything.

### Prof. Dr. Harrison, MD of Harvard Medical School

33. Both Dr. Deutsch and Dr. Somers requested Father to have his therapists report to court about "milestones" or "triggering events". As Dr. G was not willing to talk about therapy, Father contacted Dr. Harrison as per Dr. Deutsch's specific and pointed "recommendation".

34. Dr. H accepted to report to court in both lawsuits about Father's sessions with her.

35. Dr. H was allegedly Dr. Deutsch's "friend" and she requested to be Father's sole therapist. Father declined that. She also stated that she would not take insurance.

36. Dr. H promised early on and subsequently renewed her pledge to teach Father how to handle the seemingly "very dangerous women" Father had apparently attracted to himself.

37. Part of the original agreement was that Father would either somehow meet his 4 children at her office or otherwise arrange video taping his visitations with his children in order for Dr. H to be able to guide Father's subsequently recorded parental interactions.

38. Despite Father's efforts and patient "wait and see" approach, neither mother ever introduced her children to Dr. H. No video taping could ever be arranged either.

39. After 9 months of weekly sessions Father ended his therapy with Dr. H as the price became prohibitive with no apparent progress being made towards Father's requested "milestones".

40. Dr. H had billed Father for "individual psychotherapy without meds" up to when Dr. Deutsch interviewed her for the trial testimony. At that time the billing code changed to "family therapy" (see the relevant email attachments already sent to the clerk, Attorney McKinnon).

41. Dr. H diagnosed Father only after Dr. Deutsch's trial testimony and once she received Dr. Bursztajn's report. She then expressed agreement with Dr. Bursztajn's views and diagnosis and informed Father that she had diagnosed Father first with **PTSD [Provoke To Self-Destruct]**, as "proven by her notes".

42. Dr. H also agreed with Dr. Bursztajn's medical expert opinion that Leon's traumatic medical past could have been a factor in his reactions and should have been considered by the GAL.

43. After reading the ongoing filed motions, Dr. H repeatedly warned Father that **"you have no idea what they are capable of"** pointing to mothers' actions. She referred to them as **"very dangerous borderlines"** based on the documents without ever seeing either of the mothers.

44. While initially cautious, Father subsequently grew to appreciate Dr. H 's expertise and honesty and he later became convinced of her pure intentions in helping Father's children.

45. Dr. H never brought up medications to Father and never prescribed anything for Father. Therapy with her ended cordially with a promise from her for a "termination summary".

### Prof. Dr. Bursztajn, MD of Harvard Medical School

46. Suggested and recommended by his then new attorney, Father was fortunate to have met Dr. Bursztajn. Dr. B initially was retained as Father's expert witness in an attempt to counter-balance Dr. Deutsch 's apparent fame and influence that Father had painfully experienced.

47. Dr. B started out by personally conducting an extensive and comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and testing of Father in order to eliminate the uncertainty quoted by the GAL.

48. After countless hours spent with Father and Father's parents, Dr. B formally diagnosed Father with "delayed onset complex PTSD" in a written report to and filed with the court.

49. As a licensed medical doctor, Dr. B also attracted the attention to Leon's difficult and traumatic medical past otherwise apparently ignored by Mother-B and Dr. Deutsch.

50. With Dr. B having spent over 300 hours (6 times more than Dr. G) with Father and his case, Father also had ample opportunity to benefit from Dr. B's outstanding hands-on skills as a therapist and expert psychoanalyst. Father learned valuable coping skills as a result.

51. Dr. B focused on the children's larger family and reemphasized their need for the resumption of the close relationship and frequent contact with grandparents. They used to spend weekly afternoons with the children vs. the current two or so controlled visits per year.

52. Dr. B's report was shared with Father's and children's all other therapists in conjunction with Dr. Deutsch's GAL report, Father's motion to "Vacate Dr. Deutsch's Report" from the Woburn case as well as its accompanying comprehensive affidavit.

53. In order to deescalate the situation, as the children continued to be apparently humiliated, Father voluntarily and entirely on his own initiative released Dr. B as an expert witness.

54. Father is extremely grateful for Dr.B's services and termination of therapy with him was mutually cordial and well understood as Father's finances have also become critically tight.

55. Dr. B never brought up medications to Father and never prescribed any medication for him. Dr. B's therapy was the longest lasting, as per hours, of all of Father's therapy engagements.

### Ms. Parker, MSW

56. As per Dr. B's diagnosis, Father voluntarily contacted Ms. Parker, a therapist specializing in PTSD treatment locally in Concord. Ms. P also took insurance as payment for her services.

57. Father had weekly sessions with Ms. P for 5 months. Father was finally able to face his fears of the police and the courts and succeeded to move on as far as the mothers were concerned.

### Conclusion

58. As a result of the therapies, Father finally was able to focus on his work and make progress.

59. Father also took up "life saving" kitesurfing as recreation rebuilding his social life and health.

60. Father's therapists often noted his "resilience". He attributes this to his view that "there is always something good in everything bad" and searching for the "good " is mentally healing.

61. Mother-B's in limine motion alleges that "Father is attempting to use his therapeutic treatment as both a shield and a sword by asserting privilege by his recent assertion of this claim in this action". This cannot be further from the truth as evidenced by Father's timely emails.

62. As the two mothers are using an allegedly faulty, biased and incomplete GAL investigation by Dr. Deutsch to forcefully isolate Father from his children, while also seemingly forcefully medicating a child into submission, Father has no choice but to relinquish both his attorney/client and therapist/patient privileges in order to somehow protect all of his children.

Respectfully submitted,

## Shattered-self finally "defragmented"

Dear Former Therapists,

By a miraculous and clearly accidental turn of events, I have been able to "defragment" myself and file identical copies of my facts, i.e. "myself", directly to both judges (see attachments, FYI). As I feel that I have thus finally defended my own integrity and, most importantly, my children's future "anchors" from Dr. Deutsch's apparent "splitting and fragmenting" efforts of my person, I do not feel under extreme duress anymore. I have full faith that the judges and our courts will defend my innocent little children at the end with whatever judgement they may bring. I also feel that I have done everything I could to protect them.

I have not felt this relieved since my divorce from Abigail and I can now finally put my memories and horrific paralyzing fears of Attorney Inker to rest as well. This has been a truly horrible and terrifying life experience. But there is no better treatment than facing your own worst fears. Testifying entirely on your own for 7 hours straight against a pack of attorneys is also an unbelievable therapy.

I feel that Inker has been the true sickness here (see last attachment), just as I voiced this to Dr. Deutsch, as is clearly visible from her own handwritten notes. I continue to pray for the same relief and peace for my little children as I just stumbled upon.

Thank you again for your priceless efforts and Happy Holidays!

Sincerely,

## Renewed call to sanction attorneys

**NOW COMES** the Plaintiff, Andreas Laker, (“Father”), in the above-captioned matters with Defendants, Ms. Abigail Rutland and/or Ms. Alessia Woburn, (“Mother-B” and “Mother-C” or “Mothers”) and referring to his hereby incorporated **Father’s Affidavit** states as follows:

### Free for all, as long as one is a lawyer

1. Both lawsuits were simultaneously started in May of 2011 in the Cambridge Family Court and were initiated with false statements to the Police, DCF, schools, doctors, and GALs.

2. Notorious attorneys immediately materialized the initial fraud by filing more maliciously deceiving, and viciously damaging false statements, affidavits and testimonies with the Court.

3. The seemingly “free for all, as long as one is a lawyer” environment of the Family Court allowed a literal army of attorneys, all “protecting women” by effectively victimizing them, to shamelessly descend on these cases, while cruelly abusing the little children, as follows:

4. Notorious predator **Attys. Otis**, BBO 636352, and **Lenihan**, 661599, fraudulently originated the lawsuits, systematically lied to the Court, knowingly suborned their client to lie in Court, openly destroyed a loving Father’s reputation, bullied and threatened everyone they came in contact with, and deliberately devised ways to repeatedly torture children for “high-conflict”.

5. **Attys. Foley**, 173600, and **Menard Dalton**, 668580, relentlessly and falsely portrayed Father as a sex-addicted child abuser while shamelessly scheming to extort as much money as they could from the single mother of three, with no income, no savings, no ability to work, etc.

6. The Partner **Atty. Zupcofska**, 541440, along with now Chair, Divorce & Family, **Atty. Nardone**, 638352, and Atty. Howard, all from prestigious Burns & Levinson, LLP, while fully informed of the fraud and deception behind Dr. Deutsch’s, the GAL’s, investigations, openly pressured Father. To either settle, thus forever submitting his children to emotional suffering, or to get wasted in a hopeless $1,000,000 trial with a thoroughly biased judge.

7. Another Partner **Atty. Iannuzzi**, 55953, and child predator **Atty. Lacivita**, 648600, shamelessly kept appearing in Court to make ruthless, child abuse claims while also admitting to not having cared enough even to read the matter. And to openly deceive about millions of “lost” dollars while also having all subpoenaed bank records on hand. And to keep churning with endless false allegations and complaints only to demand $163,399 in legal fees from the single mother of three little children, living on government aid by then.

8. “Trojan Horse” **Atty. Harris**, 668150, who initially promised to rectify the massive invalidation initiated by Dr. Deutsch’s sadistically cruel, child abusive, and fraudulent investigation. But who soon succumbed to the endless threats and ruthless bullying of the other attorneys, and the vast “feeder network,” and chose to conspire against and sabotage Father, while officially representing him in Court on a never communicated “pro bono” basis.

9. Yet another Partner **Atty. Xavier**, 644844, and **Atty. Rehmer**, 693646, at “The Best Law Firm in the Nation for 2019” filed blatantly frivolous and absurd, child abusive complaints, thus severely overloading this Family Court with an enormous amount of documents, while themselves making no attempt whatsoever at the attorney-required “due diligence” or the respectfully child-protecting, “reach out for resolution” and “seek a compromise” steps.

### Lawyers ripping children apart

10. The last two attorneys also motioned this Court in a confrontational manner to appoint even more attorneys. The motion was utterly neglectful for the children’s best interest, emotional wellbeing, and their notedly urgent need of the Court causing “no more harm” to them.

11. Cruelly delegating all responsibility and the consequences of making life-altering decisions squarely onto the profoundly victimized, then 14 yo children cannot be in their best interests, regardless of how they may feel at the moment, under extreme, existentially torturing duress.

12. The Court nevertheless forcefully appointed the 28th attorney, **ARC Atty. Ronan**, 659393.

13. Ronan acknowledged that the 15 yo twins “have been through a lot in this matter; GAL, parenting supervisor and a long drawn out court litigation.” He neglected to inform that, perhaps due to the cruel games lawyers had played with their lives all along for profit, the children would often voluntarily exclaim during visitations that **“all lawyers were liars.”**

14. As Ms. Brice, the “Mother of the Mass. supervised visitation program”, had been vocal about her hatred of lawyers and how “she had to mop up the mess lawyers left behind,” Ronan left out that the twins would voluntarily commiserate with her in chorus **“we hate lawyers too.”**

15. Ronan hastily wrote to the Family Court that “[the twins] do not want to see the Father or communicate with him in any form and they do not want to try to mend the relationship.”

16. Ronan then responded to Father: “For your edification, I am not an investigator. I represent the children and put forth their position. My job is to represent your children and let the court know what their position is, not what my recommendations would be if I were a GAL.”

17. He suddenly became confused about his “job,” as he wrote: “any type of order that the Court enters will cause a further and deepening division between the Father and the children.”

18. Ronan knows he is not a GAL, yet he still lectures: “the children need space to mature and grow.“ Is that the **“position”** of 15 yo tortured and abused fatherless children? Or is it a cruel activist adult’s **“recommendation”** for 15 yo tortured and abused fatherless children?

19. Ronan, a careless arrogant sociopath, who conveniently gets appointed by the Court to represent helpless, fatherless children, and only to get the “job” done, with no psychological screening, then quickly switches roles again to deliver a final blow: “both children were adamant that neither wants a relationship with Father.” No wonder Ronan then gets alarmed while complaining to the Court, **“Father has cc'd Elizabeth Warren on certain e-mails.”**

20. To increase his “representing” leverage to the Court, Ronan then blatantly misrepresents trivially verifiable facts. He wrote: “the children stated how he didn't call on the children's birthday and they do not receive presents.” Yet, Father’s “birthday” email sent directly to Xavier, as direct emails to Mother-B, and the children were prohibited, proves the exact opposite. Ronan also obstructed Father’s countless, unanswered “internet” calls to his twins.

21. Had Ronan known about the “birthday” email? Why would he misrepresent it then? Or was he just careless, making sloppy mistakes, “scripting the case” while ruthlessly and cruelly playing with the lives of children? Or, was perhaps Xavier withholding it for gross profit?

22. One could say everyone makes mistakes. But Ronan also writes: “He stopped the parenting time and his phone calls.” Once again, Ronan seems to want to get the Court’s “dirty job” done by blatantly misrepresenting quickly verifiable facts, as Father’s “phone calls” email proves the opposite of what ARC Ronan seems to project. Father wrote to Mother-B: “I just wanted to let you know that I still continue to call my children. My phone still logs the calls. However, AT&T has suspended my account, and the calls don’t complete anymore.”

23. Father’s prior email to Mother-B had been: “As you can see from my attachments, my AT&T bills have not been paid, and it seems that my phone just stopped working. I can still be reached through the internet for free (Skype, FaceTime, etc., the options are limitless), and I fully intend to make all efforts and use all options available to me to call my children.”

24. Is Ronan sloppy? Or is he simply a ruthless sociopath preying on other’s helpless, fatherless, tortured, and abused children to score free points with the Family Court? Once again, Ronan **obstructed from Father’s countless, desperate, unanswered “internet” calls to his twins.**

### Layman’s words mean nothing in court

25. While fully crediting the flawed, biased, and incomplete GAL reports from Dr. Deutsch and the malicious claims by attorneys, the Court refused to even look at the hundreds of pictures of the dear children with their Father taken throughout their entire life up to the lawsuits.

26. Father will continue to make attempts to show the Family Court the photo albums, a selection of a few hundred out of 20,000+ pictures; he cherishes daily in lieu of his completely lost and destroyed connections with his children. Father’s photo albums were ignored every hearing!

27. Moreover, the Family Court systematically ignored Father’s filed candid Pro Se motions and affidavits, unless Father’s words could somehow be turned against him. Just recently, on December 17, 2018, Father was finally able to schedule his six core motions written a long time ago. By January 11, 2019, the Family Court suddenly “changed the rules,” and Father’s attempt to have the Court accept the identical motions in the other cases were turned down.

28. Father has been threatened multiple times in the Family Court to behave “just like a lawyer,” as the Court would not make any exceptions, even though Father has never asked for any special treatment, and he has made every effort to comply with all the rules of the Court.

### Trashing, discrediting in Family Court

29. During the February 20, 2019 hearing, Xavier verbally expanded on his malicious filings by advising the Court to order Father, who has twice as many advanced degrees as him, to go “flip burgers” in order to pay the mere ~$255 defrauding and humiliating child support to a deeply victimized, still millionaire “Whole Foods cashier”, and child-abandoning Mother-B.

30. Xavier was seemingly intently deceiving the Court from the start by hiding that Father had already owed ~$100,000 in child support, and Mother-C had requested assistance from the DOR. Without Xavier’s fraud, the Family Court could not have silently overridden their long-established precedent of Mother-C getting the calculated child support before Mother-B.

31. Since Xavier filed his appearance, Father reached out to him and offered to share his “first wave” of few hundred documents, all images of the originals of the **200+ motions** and other documents filed with the Court through the years and the 60+ Court hearings in these cases.

32. As Xavier declined, it is no surprise that he remains utterly ill-informed. He still endlessly harasses with frivolously filed complaints and pleadings, while churning these monster cases.

33. Had Xavier done any due diligence, he would have quickly found that his client, Mother-B testified on November 20, 2009, in Concord District Court: **“Yes, your Honor. First of all, I'd like to say that I have known [Father], for about 15 years, and during those 15 years well yes we are divorced, he never once raised his hand, or I never felt threatened. There were never arguments; we are divorced, but never did I feel physically threatened by him.”**

34. More digging and actual “professional” work required of divorce attorneys would have also enlightened Xavier that Atty. Robin Nardone, of the prestigious Burns & Levinson firm, not just witnessed but also carefully coordinated Mother-B’s testimony in free will on that day.

35. The Cambridge Family Court is seemingly content with allowing bullying, but “prestigious,” ~$500 / hour divorce attorneys, without any proven factual knowledge nor the slightest professional effort invested in due diligence, to go around and **systematically accuse, trash, invalidate, discredit, destroy and publicly humiliate fathers**. The loving, caring, and providing fathers of all those little children; the Family Court is so vocal about protecting.

36. Countless of Father’s available emails sent to Xavier point to systematic deception, lying, obstruction, withholding, misrepresentation, etc. as he falsified Father’s attempts to clarify, settle, resolve, heal, and to desperately initiate contact/create a connection with his children.

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to order a review or investigation into the conduct of the listed “trusted officers” of this Family Court allegedly “protecting” Massachusetts children.

Respectfully resubmitted,
