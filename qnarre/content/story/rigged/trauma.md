## Surgery at Boston Children's: just in time!

Dear Dr. Harrison,

For some time now I have been reflecting on Leon's reported feelings towards me to see what, if anything, I can do differently than we have been doing over the past year or so to improve his feelings and to reduce his fears. I feel that I need to write this down before I talk to you to make sure that I am clearly communicating what I am feeling, which has at times been a problem for me.

Upon reflection, and after consulting with Dr. Bursztajn, I believe that the impact of Leon's medical treatments for his bladder defect when he was just 4 and a half years old is something that must be explored in order to get to the root of his feelings towards me. The entire experience is one that was excruciating for me emotionally and for Leon both physically and emotionally. It was something that he and I went through together, without Abigail.

Leon had to undergo a forced catheterization, without anesthesia and he was screaming, begging, crying to make us stop. He was bleeding and obviously in excruciating pain. I was hugging him, kissing him and trying to calm him down. I kept telling him that it will be alright, that everything will be OK.

The two nurses were holding his legs down and spread while the doctor was inserting the catheter. The doctor had told me that he couldn't use any painkillers or anesthetics because they wouldn't work. Then halfway in, Leon kicked himself free and screamed at me "I hate you daddy, I hate you". I couldn't hold him down any longer. I had to let go of him, I felt that I was going to throw up.

Two more nurses came in and one took over from me and used real force to pin him down. Leon was just sobbing then but suddenly started screaming and trashing hard, he was in so much pain and I was just standing there crying. I couldn't help my son and I couldn't save him from the pain. After the catheter was in they started to pump that fluid in to fill up his bladder. Leon was screaming from the pain and he wouldn't look at me anymore. I felt so sorry for Leon and what he was going through and I felt powerless. I personally never experienced anything like what my son was going through but I kept telling myself that this was to save his life and to save his kidneys and his brain from unavoidable and certain future damage.

After the tests, Leon wouldn't look at me anymore. I had to promise him that something like that will never happen again. I didn't know that he would come out of the surgery with another catheter. When he woke up, the first thing he noticed was the tube sticking out. He started screaming at me "you promised, you promised" and then the **"I hate you daddy, I hate you"**. After the surgery the catheter was stuck. I simply couldn't stay in the room while they were pulling it out. I simply could not look into my son's eyes.

In the months leading up to his surgery, Leon had 105.5 fevers and he began hallucinating one night. I remember the way he was screaming and trying to defend himself from me because he somehow thought that I was the shark that wanted to kill him. His mother had brought him a stuffed shark at the hospital, where he was admitted to because of sudden fluids and weight loss way before his bladder defect was found, and Leon was hallucinating and he thought that I wanted to kill him. He "saw" me being the shark and he was screaming at me and tried to hit me as I hugged him and took him into the shower to quickly cool him down before rushing him to the emergency room.

Everyone has asked me to consider how Leon is feeling and I can't help but think of how he felt about my role in his painful year long treatments. I was the one who brought him to the hospital where they catheterized him and hurt him - I even helped hold him down. He believes that I lied to him when I promised no more catheters when the reality is that I didn't know it was going to happen from being catheterized again after surgery. I believe that I let my son down in his eyes by not being able to keep him from this pain and his seemingly never ending sickness. Although he may not know it, I think that he blames me for the pain that he experienced because he did not understand what was going on at the time due to his young age and because we have never really spoken about it since.

Although I have mentioned Leon's bladder defect to you in the past, and I explained it in detail to Dr. Deutsch during her investigation, I am not sure that we have looked into how it may have impacted Leon's feelings towards me and what I and the professionals involved in this case can do to help him work through those feelings. I have been trying so hard to forget all of this because it was painful for me and for Leon but I believe that to help Leon we need to discuss it.

I have jumped through every hoop that I have been asked to jump through for the sake of Leon and Lisa but if the GAL report is to be believed Leon still "fears" me and not enough, if really anything at all, has been done during the last year to help him through this. I am raising this issue with you because I need to know that I have done everything in power to help Leon through this and to be the best parent that I can be for all of my children. Because of your medical training as well as mental health and parent coaching experience, I am hopeful that you will be able to shed some light on this issue.

Sincerely,

"Andreas, I don't know if I mentioned to you that I am familiar with this procedure, VCUG, which is indeed an awful experience for kids and definitely could be a factor (among others probably, since everything is complicated). I spent time in pediatric surgery in medical school and learned about this procedure and also have treated children who have had this test. we can talk about it this afternoon. Alex"

## Dr. Deutsch's "Men Are Structured" Trick

Atty. Harris,

After Dr. Bursztajn and I left your office we stopped at the restaurant at the corner to get some sandwiches. And he made an interesting comment, asking if I could "hear the music". I believe that he was referring to my very black-and-white state during your questions after talking about the police. I have been thinking a lot about that. Especially because I believe I lived the most-colorful life during the 4 years with Lisa and Leon (somehow Alessia was part of that too on an adult level).

Then I realized that for some reason I have been ignoring all the details during the lawsuit that provided all the color. And that was really pronounced during the questioning and even with Dr. Deutsch last summer. Now I am in the process of "re-accumulating" all the detail about those important topics.

Here is an example, the **"weight issue"**:

I have been stepping on the scale in the mornings for some time now. I say "every day" but in fact I just checked the records of my new, iPad connected, scale and my routine really comes out to a max of 3-4 days a week. I'm not sure exactly how.

After Abigail left in 2007, the [3.5 yo] children started their habit of always running to my bedroom as soon as they got up. Leon has been a very light sleeper and he would always get up at dawn. I am not a morning person and like to sleep later. The way I tried to stay in bed longer was by allowing the children to climb into bed with me in the mornings and let them even fall asleep. Of course once I got up, that was it.

They followed me everywhere and they of course liked to jump on the scale. Initially I never paid attention to their numbers. I was still sleepy and was sort-of doing my own things right after getting out of bed. During the summer of 2008 that same routine continued but now there were 3 kids and the two of us, Alessia and I.

Leon unfortunately was very sickly all summer long. He was in the hospital once for loosing too much weight during a sinus infection. Then he started the high-fever sessions. In the fall I had been in almost constant contact with Dr. Goldsmith doing all the tests. When the bladder defect came through we started the same tests with Lisa too. Then Dr. Diamond from Children's prescribed daily antibiotics for Leon for 6 months around his surgery (Dec 2008).

I visited Dr. Goldsmith's office and called her many many times during that period. Leon was  very weak and he didn't gain any weight the entire year. I wasn't really paying attention to the weight then because I was more concerned about his kidney infections. After the surgery he had to go back for a checkup in the spring of 2009. He checked out fine and then Dr. Goldsmith checked him and Leon suddenly gained 7 pounds (when he was 40 that was huge).

Dr. Goldsmith was very excited about that because it was her who caught this major problem and the fact that Leon didn't have any kidney damage was attributable to her (and to me somewhat for reacting fast). That was the time when I realized that keeping an eye on the weight is so important and that is why the first thing the doctors do is get your measurements. But I didn't start watching their numbers yet.

Then Dr. Goldsmith continued being proactive with Leon because of his allergies. In the fall of 2009 she sent me to see Dr. Riester at Lahey Clinic, an allergist. It was then that suddenly came out that Leon now was having allergies from pollen as well. Dr. Riester told me that he would prescribe nasal spray for Leon but one has to be careful. And the allergies themselves are not the real problem. It is the sinus infections that damage the tissues afterward.

And he gave me a lot of advice on how to keep Leon from getting infections. That is where I learned about not blowing too much (the sucking was my idea), about fresh cold air in the mornings and an otherwise healthy lifestyles and sports so that Leon can grow out of his allergies if at all possible. It was after seeing Dr. Riester in the fall of 2009 when I started really focusing on the children's health. For me the defects and allergies were a wakeup call. The children were in kindergarten then and they already learned their numbers.

Then in the spring of 2010 Leon's teacher told me that he was doing very good in the special focus group (alone) for reading and he could benefit from being alone at times in a calm setting. After that I introduced the alone time for 10 minutes in their own rooms in the mornings doing something rewarding. And that was numbers and writing. Both were really excited about that. Sometimes I feel that Leon's problems are caused by Lisa doing everything "better" than him. And for Lisa that Leon gets away with a joke and pretty much anything (because he was so sick). That is how the morning "meditations" came into our lives.

I also felt encouraged because during the winter of 2009 and 2010 neither child was an antibiotics at all (while of course seeing Dr. Goldsmith regularly, Dr. Goldsmith, I felt, was paying extra attention on us because of all the major issues). During every single winter before, antibiotics were a monthly thing. In the winter of 2010 swimming came into the picture. And if you remember, there was a lot of snow during that winter. They started the swimming in October and it went until the end of March. During that time we couldn't really run outside hence in the mornings I opened the windows and the children ran around laughing and playing inside the house while I was preparing their launches.

So, saying that the children ran 10 laps and then swam the same day is not really true. All of these "activities" were continuously evolving and they were introduced as a result of some sort of problem and based on the advice I was getting after talking and listening to all the people around me. Even now I remember Dr. Riester's words "it is not the allergies that cause the problems, it is the inflammation and infections because of the allergic reactions". When I told about this to Dr. Goldsmith it was her to recommend Cod Liver Oil (not prescribe!) and the yogurts and probiotics because the extremely long antibiotics session **[one year daily!]** for Leon.

As you can see, the routine of stepping on the scale and the other "structured" stuff was more of a slowly evolving, adapting and learning process. I need to keep remembering these details, otherwise I will simply follow the intimidations and answer the questions with a yes or no. **None of this stuff is black-and-white.** Only my fears make me explain them in black-and-white.

And my lack of using the colloquialisms (I learned English when I was 24). For example, "more often than not" is simply not in my active vocabulary. And what I would use for it in Hungarian translates back into English as "generally" which simply doesn't give the same meaning. And when I am stressed I still think in Hungarian. No wonder I blurted quite a few Hungarian words at the three police officers back a year ago. 

Anyways, I feel that I am on the right track and perhaps you could give me a few more phrases that I should use. Now that I am actively recovering all the detail "color" from my memory I don't feel that stressed anymore. **The 4 years with Leon and Lisa were really the happiest years of my life.**

---

One more thing. In the spring of 2008, Dr. Goldsmith sent Leon to the hospital for 2 days exactly because his weight dropped so much during one of his never ending "colds". He was already taking antibiotics  but Dr. Goldsmith wanted Leon to get his fluids back and to stop loosing more weight. Leon was put on IV. Abigail came to visit him as well and Dr. Goldsmith and Abigail ran into each other right in Leon's room. I told about this to Dr. Deutsch.

---

It would be good to know if Leon has had infections since in Abigail's care. He had complained about sore throat and ear aches almost continuously during the winter but I tried my best to not raise any issues regarding his health or weight. The last time he had sore throat and a really plugged up nose was about a month ago. I gave him a tissue but never said anything about blowing his nose or not.

I never contacted their new pediatricians because it would have been "obsession" regarding the children's health. I don't know if Leon is using any medications or sprays or if he has been on antibiotics at all. Regardless, I am really excited about them going back to Dr. Goldsmith. I felt that I had a really good working relationship with her. I feel that she has a very good sense of health issues.

## "Neither [GAL] Has Any Training Or Experience In Medicine Or Pediatrics"

```python
"I think that it would be helpful for each of you to review the GAL standards that are applicable to Kivisto and Deutsch here. It is different than their professional standards as mental health workers. I anticipate that this is something that they will use to cross examine Dr. Bursztajn on."
```

> Atty. Erin Harris

```python
"Thank you Erin, will study further. That is a great resource for cross examine both Deutsch & Kivisto. For example, there is the requirement for objectivity. Also expertise, **neither has any training or experience in medicine or pediatrics**. In terms of multiple sources neither make any effort to speak to the previously involved grandparents or to learn about the family's culture or complex trauma during [Ceausescu's] reign of terror."

"In addition the Nondiscriminatory requirement clearly spells out that such factors which have the potential for discrimination as ethnicity need to be studied by the GAL and the GAL needs to inform the court about."

"Will give more thought..."

## Elite Child Predators' "Toxic Masculinity" Ideology

Dear Dr. Harrison,

I feel that the attached conversation with Abigail is essential in understanding the children's medical hardships and possibly how they feel and think. I have been talking about these all along, however, since Dr. Bursztajn pointed out some seemingly crucial connections to me with his deeply caring and very skillful questions, they became even more important in my mind.

I would like to talk about these and other details of the twin's medical history in our next sessions. This would be in seemingly direct response to your request of me trying to imagine how the children could feel and think.

For completeness sake I have attached the entire text conversation in the second attachment. Just before talking about the medical issues we texted about setting up the laptops. This seems to me a proof that something is changing in Abigail and my relationship. Unfortunately only Leon's mine craft game was installed today. For some reason Lisa's version has to wait 48 hours (and Leon doesn't share his laptop). Of course, she is strong and will just have to learn to take it.

```python
"Ok. He is happy. More allergy tests today. Not allergic to crab lobster shrimp scallops pine nuts. Very allergic to walnuts pecans peanuts."
```

> Abigail

Good. Dr. Riester was concerned about new allergies and that hopefully stopped. Pine nuts is good news. Pesto is very good and healthy. Lisa seemed hurt for not knowing about the laptops and car key detail. I never tried lobster but we have had shrimp before. They tested that back in 2009.

```python
"Oh. I was not aware of that. Dr Riester said he had not need tested for sea food."

"She knew that you were bringing them. What was she hurt about? They both are always trying to read emails and texts. They want to know everything. And get mad if I tell them it is adult stuff."
```

At the time he was worried about new allergies because of all the infections and long-term antibiotics. But it seems that we are over that phase. Shrimp is good but I personally have issues with lobster since I got sick.

Dr. Diamond also brought Dr. Goldsmith's attention to this. I believe that's why she was asking for tests from Dr. Riester. Dr. Goldsmith was very proud of catching the kidney infections in time and wanted to be preemptive with other defects. You remember Lisa went through the same tests because the twin factor. Dr. Diamond was driving that. Bladder for defects. There is a high occurrence of the same defects in twins.

```python
"I thought it was bladder inventions not kidney infections? What tests did Lisa have?"
```

Leon had 2 kidney infections with 105.5 fever and hallucinations. I took him to the hospital at 2 am. That's why they started looking for the bladder defect. Then he had those awful catheter tests where the poor boy was screaming from the pain. Dr. Goldsmith knew and recommended them all. Leon had a horrible few months then. Ask Dr. Goldsmith. I was on the phone with her every two weeks. It all started when she admitted him to the hospital for loosing weight and fluids. You ran into Dr. Goldsmith right in Leon's room. You gave him the stuffed shark.

```python
"I know. I remember all of that. I was always under the impression it was bladder infections not kidney infections. I thought you were saying Lisa had allergy tests. That is all."
```

Leon had a bladder defect and reflux because of the placement of the defect right next to the double tubes (abnormal) leading to the kidney. So all the infected urine that did not empty from his bladder was pushed back into the kidney. That's why he had the very high fevers. Dr. Diamond explained it all. I thought that you called him as well. Didn't you say that you had talked to him? **I cannot believe you don't remember this**. Ask Dr. Goldsmith. 

The X-ray test showed it clearly how the urine was going back into the kidney. All of it made clear sense and Dr. Goldsmith was extremely proud for catching it in time. Kidney damage comes very fast and it is a most serious condition. I'm shocked and horrified that none of this was discussed a year ago **[during Dr. Deutsch's investigation]. The medical doctors have been short circuited.** Of course the high fevers for kidney infections will damage the brain. Leon was hallucinating that night. He thought that I was a shark. I quickly put him in the shower and ran to the emergency room. Alessia watched Lisa and Steve. Done. Sorry.

```python
"Andreas I remember all of this very well. You need to stop this now. I suppose you are planning to use this as proof of something. Of course I remember it all very well. Especially how you had your girlfriend smash his favorite toy in the trash compactor 3 days before his surgery. This is why I absolutely avoid talking to you. Show this to your therapist. Of you actually have one. Because you really need help. Those kids do not deserve this."
```

Abigail, I fully agree with you that our poor children don't deserve this. There has been a lot of wrong doing and the damage is enormous. And it is only the two of us that care about our children. Is it a personality disorder on my part that I vividly remember talking about these, in my opinion very serious parenting issues, to the GAL? If it is then I guess i will have to live with them.

I have nightmares remembering Leon screaming from pain during the tests, during his sickness and he was so afraid just before Dr. Diamond put him to sleep before the surgery. Remembering those is part of my therapy. And of course I will show this to all of my therapists. I love my children and I care for them deeply. And please remember, it is only the two of us that care for them. Once the money is gone it will be only the two of us left for our children.

```python
"Andreas I realized that a long time ago. You for some reason feel that you need to spend every dime. I have no idea what you think that will do to enhance their lives."
```

Please have some empathy. Have you ever been completely shut off from your children by someone who completely disregards medical facts and willfully lies about my own mother? My only defense in this case is to spend all I have in the hopes of her moving on. Have you ever thought about how you would defend yourself from a "possible personality disorder" judgment based on no facts?

No wonder I feel that Romania is happening all over again. My only defense is to eliminate my attractiveness to such ruthless predators. I am saying all this in the hopes of you understanding that I fully believe that there are only two people who will truly care about our children: you and I. There rest is all money driven.

```python
"Oh please. Your mother? Your mother told you to stop that night. Now she is going to lie for you. I don't think you really care about what is best for the kids. You just keep lying to everyone. But the kids lived through it and they are not going to forget. This is all about you. Read what you wrote. All you."
```

Taking my son to the hospital while screaming is about me? Had I ignored his fevers maybe he would remember me as an angel. He screamed at me because I was the one who took him. That really wasn't about me. And lying about my mother "staying in Romania" wasn't about me either. Sorry, but you don't make sense. Anyways, I really don't want to argue with you. I firmly believe that it is only the two of us who will stop the destruction. I want to stop it. Do you? I need to go now, I will see the kids shortly.

```python
"The fact that you are insisting on sending this stuff to me today is about you and your heroics. Nothing else. I never told anyone that your mother stayed in Romania. She came 4 years after your dad."
```

I am not attacking you. I don't want to destroy you and I certainly have no interest in damaging your relationship with our children.

```python
"We are where we are because of you. You cannot destroy me and you cannot damage my relationship with my kids."
```

Abigail, this is not about you. **This is about predators who took advantage of our emotional instability.** Simple like that. I do not want to fight with you. I told all about my mother to the GAL [Dr. Deutsch]. She falsified what I personally told her. I know I cannot and I don't want it either. Ok. I need to go because I will be late.

```python
"Lisa had a stomach ache after the quarter pounder and ice cream."
```

Sorry to hear that, poor Lisa. I will keep it in mind for the future. I'm getting some popcorn for tonight. She seemed very hungry and she ate very fast.

```python
"She was constipated to begin with. A quarter pounder is 520 calories. Cheeseburger is 300. Grilled chicken is 350. Even double cheese is 440."
```

Got it. No more. I will apologize to her.

```python
"No need to apologize. She will be embarrassed. She has become very private about that stuff."
```

Even better. No problem.
