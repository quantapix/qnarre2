# Dear First Justice

{@a top}

I am writing to you Sir in reference to the Honorable Court's two Judgments handed down on February 13, 2014 (J. Gibson) and June 30, 2014 (J. Donnelly). I was the defendant (and "Father" from here on, depending on the context) in the two parallel "custody" cases.

## Circumstances of this letter

Both cases, apparently perceived by the Court to be about 4 innocent little children, ended in lengthy trials, with a total of 60+ hearings, depositions, interviews, subpoenas, multiple and repeated GAL investigations by Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) psychologists. The lawsuits lasted over 3 excruciatingly long years.

8 Harvard psychologists/psychiatrists (Drs. Bursztajn MD, Daignault, Deutsch, Goldblatt MD, Harrison MD, Kivisto, Olezeski and Von Broembsen), countless therapists, medical doctors, teachers and other professionals were all witnesses or, perhaps, even maliciously willing actors. Father was recast into two conveniently disjointed identities and forced under a terrorizing microscope with no checks for reality afforded.

24 lawyers and 4 appointed seasoned psychologist GALs (Drs. Deutsch, Olezeski, Kivisto and Somers) made their marks on the proceedings while millions of dollars changed hands due to the professionals' seemingly scripted actions. Local police was involved 3 times, DCF 3 times and 5 restraining orders were filed to intimidate, as all were dismissed upon hearings.

The children were apparently unnecessarily "treated" by Boston Children's Hospital and MGH for "delayed development" and a painful oncological surgery. They were also misdiagnosed while maliciously disregarding the effects of documented past kidney infections, a bladder-repair surgery, year-long antibiotic treatment, with extensive allergies as resulting side-effects.

Additional New Hampshire doctors and therapists were called on, safely across the state border, to seemingly forcefully medicate and professionally "brainwash" the children into final submission. Premium insurance, by Blue Cross and Blue Shield, was applied in a long-term and apparently systematic health insurance fraud as leverage in court proceedings.

Father endured 5 years of weekly supervisions with his 4 children and almost daily minimal (4-6 sentences) recorded phone calls with his twins, a boy and a girl. The younger children, another boy and girl, never once had a phone conversation with their father, nor have they ever met anyone from their father's side of the family, e.g. loving and eager grandparents.

Neither the supervised visits (well into the hundreds) nor Mother's recorded calls (thousands) resulted in any, reported or not, wrongdoing on Father's part. He has not had any contact with his children in any other way for 6 years now. By professionally leveraging this Court, Father's full alienation from his children has been maliciously accomplished by the actors.

**Despite Father's unprecedented, sustained and wide-ranging desperate efforts, his 4 children were forced to loose connection with him since September 2016.**

I need to emphasize that I love my children, I have not harmed them, I will never abandon them and I have been/will be unconditionally supporting them in every imaginable way regardless of the circumstances (obviously including financial support to literally my last penny as well as the current public effort to raise funds and develop specialized software).

Nevertheless, I will also resist any coercion to torture my children in order to, for example, allegedly "protect my own emotions". Or better yet, as per the current federal crime allegation, to provide a final "gotcha" to the eager and decidedly psychopathic actors, thus presumably proving them right despite their documented malicious intentions and actions.

An undeniably most effective authoritarian tool of terror in human history, the "show me the man and I'll find you the crime" is the keystone of fascism and tyranny. It seems that the extensive, endless and apparently predatory feminist agenda-driven "supervised visitation program" mandated by the openly mislead courts has exactly that as its main/sole objective.

## Nature of this public letter/blog

This letter is an open, public letter and will be posted on a website/blog with the title "Predatory Feminism is Fascism" in due time along with over 100,000+ pieces of authenticated and traceable communications and documents. All relevant facts, fragments and quotes will be cross-linked to their respective supporting, original sources for instant verifiability.

In order to protect the identity and wellbeing of the children and their parents, the public postings will be fully redacted. Names of mentioned professionals will refer to only the identity of their licensed "serve the public for a fee" entity. No other information about them is known to Father nor will be published by Father on the website or elsewhere.

## Timing of this letter

This letter was timed to coincide with the 3 year anniversary of the ending of all court actions. There have been several damaging allegations against the parents and by waiting for this day, Father attempted to ensure the expiration of the Massachusetts Statue of Limitations in order to protect his children and their Mothers.

This letter hereby implies the following trivial motions by Father to this Honorable Court:

a) **seal the names of the children and parents to protect their safety from predators, including from some of the herein mentioned professionals.**

b) provide full criminal immunity to the Mothers (the Court has seemingly turned a blind eye, perhaps to protect the children at the time, to the systematic victimization of women, and mothers, by trusted insiders: the loudly "protecting", yet fundamentally predatory "feminist" lawyers, GALs, therapists and supervised visitation monitors).

c) clarify the conflicting Court orders such as "...any information relating to this judgment...actions contained herein not to be disseminated outside of this Court..." As a witness to an alleged serious and malicious crime, Father feels the need to alert the authorities "outside of this Court" to investigate. He claimed "extreme legal duress" during trial, under oath, and was ignored, perhaps to protect the children at the time.

d) resolve the contradiction between "...Father shall continue to attend individual therapy sessions" and the Court's refusal to hear his long list of psychologists and psychiatrists including elite Harvard professors (some with almost a 1,000 GAL appointments).

e) reconsider the Court's final judgments due to alleged subornation of perjury, malicious fraud, legal misrepresentation, collusion of the GALs with alleged crimes, medical malpractice and long term systematic "professional" abuse of children as hostages.

f) rule on a **third** request by Father to end the "hostage crisis", the extensive victimization of the families and the documented massive invalidation of individuals not "in the know" and to seek normalizing relationships among little children and their parents.

g) initiate a full GAL/criminal/internal investigation as Dr. Deutsch apparently reused the "boiler-plated" script from her other "400+" "high conflict" (i.e. "lots of money" - Court officers) investigations. Father volunteers all his traceable and authenticated documentation including filings, letters, emails, messages, transcripts, reports, etc.

h) investigate the significant financial aspects of the matters followed by a resolution, retributions and due remedies for the wide spectrum of alleged fraud and inflicted damages, including extreme debilitating physical, mental and emotional pain/sufferings.

i) **restore Father's "right to work"**. Due to the numerous publicly filed malicious and allegedly fraudulent motions, Father is simply not employable. As the Mothers seem to be conditioned on his child support, his ability to work is existentially critical.

The motions are requested on an emergency basis as the alleged federal crimes will be expiring soon. Father is available to appear in Court and to provide any requested justifications or explanations in person and also to materialize all necessary submissions if needed. This letter will be forwarded to the local police, DA's office and the FBI by July 17th, 2017.

Father has depleted his personal and his company's funds. He is homeless with an actual net worth of an effective $0 (except for a ~$50K SEP-IRA) and he has been without salary this year. Despite all his efforts otherwise, he will not be able to continue to pay child support, expenses or health insurance starting in August 2017. His entire existence has been denied.

**Father is effectively unemployable per malicious and allegedly fraudulent public court filings.** Yet, he is willing, able and capable to work. He funded his company as soon as the lawsuits were finally launched, received a steady, competitive salary ($70K, thus double-taxing his own savings) and avoided the "unemployable" issue as long as he could.

The company has received a first round of "angel" funding by a third-party to develop a product to be released in beta in late 2017. Its assets are now entirely in IP, tied to yet unfinished, unproven software. It accumulated ~$1M in carry-over losses with no positive cash flow to date. It is in need of the pre-arranged second round of significant cash infusion.

Until the Court clears the malicious and allegedly fraudulent accusations against Father, no investors are willing to release funds. With Father's name and honor restored, the company will be able to receive the promised cash and resume normal operations and development, including paying Father's salary and health insurance premiums for him and his dependents.

**Significant Disclaimer:** Father is a complete layman, has no skills, expertise, training nor ambitions in any of the highly respected professions, especially legal and justice-related, of all the mentioned professionals in this letter, implied motions and the public website/blog.

Father is acting on a "self-representing" (Pro Se) basis with no legal advice. He has waived his attorney/client and doctor/patient privileges under extreme legal duress during the trials specifically to protect his children and families from an alleged massive predatory attack.

## Rationale for this letter

Before my marriage to Ms. Rutland, I experienced, as a "trusted insider", the spectrum of ruthless shenanigans called "win-win divorce legal strategy" by Atty. Monroe Inker. Ms. Rutland's son, Mr. Donovan's father was driven into staggering debt and out of the state by that proudly "feminist" predator and self-described "father of Mass. divorce law".

My impressions from that sad and cruel year stayed with me and resulted in perhaps irrational fears. When Ms. Rutland suddenly wanted divorce from me, I was reminded of the past and unconditionally agreed to all her demands just to specifically avoid Inker and, as he died by then, his sadistic assistant and Ms. Rutland's previous lawyer, Atty. Otis.

I told my story about Inker (also implying Otis without being explicit), to everyone I came into contact with after my divorce. Ms. Woburn, teachers, therapists, lawyers, experts and GALs had all heard of Inker. Still, my stories rang hollow and were ignored in the reports and communications, despite my pointedly self-written and self-submitted, timely records.

I had no clear, irrefutable evidence of the "win-win strategy" at work, by Otis now, when this trial started. I could not point to Ms. Rutland being purposefully victimized by Otis yet. As I had spent the year talking about the "Inker legacy" to Dr. Goldblatt, his testimony would have simply, and understandably, pointed to only "delusional and obsessed" thinking.

This Honorable Court stated in the final Judgment: *Father's attorney notified the GALs that Father would not be waiving his privilege to allow the GALs to speak with his ongoing individual therapist, Mark Goldblatt, M.D. Father continued to assert his privilege until shortly before the last day of trial. According to Massachusetts Rule of Evidence 403, "Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice." Mass. R. Evid. 403.*

*The Court finds, after careful review of Father's "Offer of Proof", that any relevant evidence Father may be able to provide pertaining to his individual therapy is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Mother. Mother was unable to conduct discovery regarding Father's individual therapy. Additionally, Father did not allow the GAL to speak to his individual therapist. Therefore, Father's Response Motion in Limine Regarding PTSD Evidence is DENIED.*

Just days after Father's initial retaining his privileges regarding Dr. Goldblatt, a significant material change occurred. Atty. Otis, knowingly and personally victimized her client, Ms. Rutland, under oath and during trial by directly coercing her to lie about, among other things, millions of her dollars, thus purposefully incriminating a now defenseless mother.

Considering the content of the GAL reports (not one, but two) by Dr. Deutsch, perhaps as evidences of conspiracy with a federal crime, and the maliciously false narrative presented to the Court up until then, Atty. Otis' actions seem premeditated, intentional and scripted according to the Inker "win-win" divorce strategy that Father had talked about to everyone.

A second significant material change occurred prior to Father finally waiving all his privileges. Atty. Harris, who had knowingly disregarded Otis' alleged crime in full view in this Court, ignored Father's plea of "extreme legal duress" during the other trial's last day and the findings filing period. She withdrew from this case two days before the last day of this trial.

**Between Father's initial denial and later request for waiving his privileges, two significant, material and allegedly criminal changes occurred: a) subornation of perjury by Atty. Otis, thus directly incriminating a defenseless mother and b) formal withdrawal of Atty. Harris as "Trojan Horse", along with her re-stating in writing to the Court Father's repeated "under extreme legal duress" plea.**

Having full documentation for two significant material changes, Father hereby requests this Honorable Court to reconsider the above mentioned justification and final judgment and allow Father to call all his therapists, including all 4 GALs, to testify under oath about the therapy they provided, investigation they conducted and diagnoses they may have had.

## Objective of this letter

While Father intends to cooperate with and follow all recommendations of a new, full and simultaneous (all 3 parents and all 4 children considered) GAL investigation, just as he did after Dr. Somers' work, he is *not* looking to re-argue the current physical custody arrangements. He continues to believe, by choice, that the mothers of his children are loving.

Father's most important priority is, and has been all these excruciating years, the physical, emotional and financial wellbeing, stability and protection of his children and his families:

**The clear and imminent danger threatening Father's children and families are the herein named "predatory feminist" agents who "operate" (i.e. professionally, skillfully and ruthlessly terrorize) by openly abusing their authority afforded to them by the Court with seemingly no due checks-and-balances whatsoever.**

Father intends to publicize the ruthless and especially cruel details and motivations of the Inker/Otis/Deutsch "win-win" elitist divorce strategy. An allegedly $50B national "Divorce Corp." grew out of these psychopathic, sociopath ideas directly targeting loved innocent children by the most sophisticated, highly creative, and arguably sickest, thinkers of society.

Father intends to disrupt this enormous "virgin" market with a novel, fully traceable, easily verifiable, "narratives on the fly", "intelligent" software package drawing from large "legal databases" (millions of pages) and using an intuitive, "natural language chatbot" interface. The motto: "built with unconditional love for our children and true passion for technology".

Father's software is built on top of a) "available, reliable and persistent" cloud-based, b) deep neural-network (aka. AI) inference engine-powered and c) blockchain verified technologies. These are all predicted to have explosive growths in the next few years and Father seeks national attention and investors to raise the necessary development funds.

## The allegation of a federal crime

Subornation of perjury is apparently "the (federal) criminal offense of procuring another to commit perjury, which is the crime of lying, in a material matter, while under oath."

Atty. Otis prompted her client, Ms. Rutland, during the trial: *Now, at the time that you were divorced from Father, do you recall what your net worth was?* Ms. Rutland replied to the direct question under oath: *I think my net worth at that time was about $2.7 million.*

This came after choreographed confirmations of a "$33M" business (the fact: $25M "as sold", half of which wiped out by the dotcom bubble), the "well over" $3M marital home that Father "kept" and the rehashing of how "tumultuous" the marriage had been. After insinuating numeric precision, Otis changed the subject and never came back to this "inflection point".

Dr. Deutsch had observed in her massively invalidating GAL report: *...the lack of affect on Mother's part could be a result of lack of care and concern for the children...this does not appear to be the case. Mother maintains that she...only accepted less parenting time after being "bullied" by Father.* She apparently reaffirmed these observations in her second report.

The orchestration between Deutsch and Otis was thus complete. The GAL "fairy tale" was now solidly and unambiguously anchored to documented reality with direct testimony from the trapped mother. As Father had filed an affidavit with over 900 discrepancies in the Deutsch report, the Court could finally gloss over all that "crazy work" from just a "bully".

"$33M" proceeds from a "shared" business; "$3.9M" house, as per her FS, "kept" by him; after giving her only $1.5M for her "half"; her only "allowed" to visit her "beloved" children. And she, a "savvy" business woman, could keep only a total net worth of "$2.7M". An irrefutable, custom-crafted infantile fairy tale by the definition of "being bullied" by a man.

At the time I glanced at Atty. Harris, almost crying, as she was looking out the window. She never attempted to address this moment neither then nor for the next year or so. Yet it was her who gave me Ms. Rutland's Fidelity statements. And she received them from Attys. Nardone and Zupcofska. And they received them directly from Atty. Otis during discovery.

They all have seen those statements, the most critical information of the lawsuits: did Father bully and "victimize" a loving Mother into abandoning her 3.5 yo adorable twins? Or is Mother simply "lacking affect", (not capable of loving, not even her children) and was simply protecting her worry-free selfish survival: her millions generating ample tax-free income.

When I retained Atty. Zupcofska for $500 / hour from the prestigious Burns & Levinson, he was quick: "a case of child abduction". Predictably, Dr. Deutsch smirked "we know Peter" before releasing her report. I then paid $150K to have her repeat "can't recall that" during deposition. Zupcofksa grinned: "Dr. Deutsch is slick, just settle". I stayed clear of the trap.

To pay for Dr. Deutsch's deposition, my only chance of protecting my families, I was forced to quickly sell the house into a buyer's market. We had purchased it for $3M in 2004, I paid $1.5M for half. I paid Ms. Rutland $1.5M in good faith for the other half in 2008. And I was forced to finally sell it for $1.5M in 2011. In just 3 years I was coerced to loose $1.5M.

By then I had enough accumulated documents for even Zupcofska to take notice. And they had just received the Fidelity statements from Atty. Otis. Suddenly I also had the $1.5M cash ("profit" as Otis later categorized it) from the house. Zupcofska became eager: "the case is doable with a trial". My cost: an extorted $1M, he even brought in the 4th lawyer.

Mother's Fidelity statements for the month of our divorce show a solid balance of $2.7M. The divorce agreement also lists her house at an additional $800,000 with $100,000 "just finished" improvements. And her other house at over $200,000. And other miscellaneous valuables of well over $100,000. The total of that would be ~$4M "net worth". Not $2.7M.

## "Bullying" father real or just convenient?

Paying child support was never acceptable for Ms. Rutland. Even her own mother took in foster children. "My mother hated kids, never talked to Ryan, strictly avoided my sister's children, Jessica and Amy, and they all lived on the same street. She took in all those poor tortured kids for the money only. They were treated and lived like pigs. I hated her for it".

During our divorce Ms. Rutland wanted out. She wanted money, she wanted freedom and she wanted to pay no support and no expenses. Her fears had always been about money. I literally begged her back then to avoid calling Atty. Otis. I had fears as well, just different. We settled quickly: I agreed to everything she demanded. Divorce took just over 6 months.

The year of our divorce was 2008, the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression. I tried to sell that monster of a house for $2.8M after the divorce, once I saw the twins stabilizing. Nobody was interested and I received no offers. I still kept trying. Ms. Rutland just laughed "good luck with that house" and "you are a stupid, weak man". She felt strong.

At the time, I was still paying a fixed ~$60K in taxes and utilities for the "mansion". After paying Ms. Rutland $1.5M for her half of it, I was left with $1.8M as money making funds. I had to keep that in interest bearing bonds for income, so I could pay for the children's and my living expenses. The financial crisis hit me extremely hard exactly because of that.

By the end of 2008 my net worth outside of the unmarketable house dropped to $1.2M providing just $66K in income. Maintaining the house for the children forced me to live entirely off of my diminished principal without having any income. Proudly dodging the crisis, Ms. Rutland "skillfully" maintained her income equivalent at $148K (5.5% of $2.7M).

Dr. Deutsch was informed, yet: **the husband "bullies" his wife into a divorce where he gets half as much cash as her, has no effective income compared to her tax-free, work-free $148K, he takes care of their children full-time with her not contributing a penny nor time. And the "savvy" victim calls the bully "stupid".**

## Fraudulent taxes by the Town of Concord?

Dr. Deutsch also chose to withhold from the Court Ms. Rutland allegedly falsifying the "grade" of the house, i.e. public records of the Town of Concord, during the divorce. Seemingly with the consent of a lawyer from Atty. Burgess' office, Ms. Rutland's act, according to Inker's strategy, skyrocketed the house's assessment (and taxes) from $3.2M to $4.6M.

Father's immediate abatement was denied. Yet, the assessment of $3.2M was restored quietly for the following year, with no record and no investigations. Father was never reimbursed for the extra $10K+ he had to pay in taxes for the fraudulent act witnessed but never reported to nor investigated by the authorities. Dr. Deutsch never mentioned this act of "bullying".

When Father was forced to sell the house for $1.5M to pay for Dr. Deutsch's deposition, thus protecting his children from the massive predatory attack, the town accepted the new owner's abatement and dropped the assessment to $2.3M. Full inspection report proves that the only reason for dropping the price was extreme legal durress experienced by Father.

A $2.6M assessment has since been restored. As taxes were levied on the same, structurally sound, unchanged "mansion" in the span of a few years through the spectrum of $3.0M, $4.6M, $3.2M, $1.5M (sold price), $2.3M, $2.6M price points, Father requests a "real" valuation. Volatility is ~80%, losses are staggering, yet judgement still builds on "bullying".

## Record of "crime" allegations

Father has notified the honorable Court every step of the way regarding the falsity and fraudulent nature of the endless malicious allegations, including the "biased, flawed and incomplete" repeated GAL investigations by Dr. Deutsch. They started with the initial alleged lying to the police and DCF, through the falsified exhibits of the first motion filed.

Father ended the record on January 31, 2014, with a motion, and lengthy list of specific exhibits, asking the Court to finally end the "hostage crisis" and protect the children and parents from "professional bullies and predators". This honorable Court, seemingly in order to protect the children and their mothers at the time, ignored Father's motion altogether.

## Attempted arrest, lying to the police

As per Atty. Inker's "win-win" divorce strategy, Ms. Rutland launched the court actions with an attempted arrest. The 3 Concord police officers had their handcuffs pulled and ready to arrest Father at his house for allegedly "badly beating" his son that same morning, just before the child went on a school field trip accompanied by his volunteering Mother.

The 2+ hour police activity in the posh neighborhood, with everyone watching the "mansion" highlighted by all the flashing blue lights in the driveway, ended only after Father finally produced a just two day old bitterly threatening email between the two mothers. After carefully reading the email, the officers put their handcuffs away and left with a "good luck".

I expected the "shock and awe" opening. I had talked with Ms. Rutland the week before and sensed her readiness to act. She distrusted my handling of the same "win-win" strategy by Atty. Foley -"most ruthless in a 100 mile radius"- on behalf of the other mother, Ms. Woburn. Baby Girl was about to be born and Ms. Rutland's window of opportunity was closing fast.

We all had experienced how Atty. Foley operated by then. She had attempted a failed restraining order despite the judge's clear instructions: "get an RO on your behalf if you feel personally scared, not on your client's behalf". I had personally told Foley about my circumstances, including Inker. She still kept promising her client $10K/month child support.

Foley had explained, to Ms. Rutland's utter horror, "if Father can't pay that much, we will get him to file for support from his multi-millionaire ex-wife and then pay support for the babies from that". Sensing the threatening dynamics, I tried to appease Ms. Woburn by gifting her $250K as "child support and expenses until I get the business going in 2-3 years".

Ms. Woburn calculated: $10K/month child support, tax-free, is about a $180K salary without any of the work. A dream come true: 3+ times as much as she had been making while working and caring for her first son. Ms. Rutland noted: "Ms. Woburn has no clue and Foley will grab all that $250K - that I had given Ms. Woburn for child support - in no time".

By then I had learned Ms. Rutland's new tactics. During my arrest by Ms. Woburn and the subsequent "knife-incident" (see links), she tried to have the school, DCF or the police file a complaint against Ms. Woburn and myself, with her being the passive but caring "victim". The school filing a direct complaint against me would have been a certain "death blow".

Sensing Ms. Rutland's "final opportunity", with her sudden volunteering for our son's school trip just a month before Ms. Woburn's due date, I had smacked my 7 yo son once, with open palms on the back of his head without his head moving as gentle disciplining with only my own mother witnessing the night before the police was called on me by Ms. Rutland.

Right after the "smacking", the children called Ms. Rutland in front of my parents on FaceTime (video phone) and they then leisurely chatted with their mother in the full privacy of their own room, just as they had done with great joy and happiness every night for years before (I was proud to have won that much from my disastrous divorce from Ms. Rutland).

When the school principal called next afternoon about an "urgent matter" she had wanted to discuss with me, I felt that I needed to act. I called **and** texted Ms. Rutland asking her to come back to pick up the children. I had to avoid the school initiating a complaint. I had known the "playbook" for that and had to have Ms. Rutland act and call the police herself.

## Father smacks son to avoid arrest

As the police pointedly observed, neither Ms. Rutland nor our son mentioned the "extra beating". She didn't know about it, despite having full and private access to our boy. She was busy executing her own plan and was blindsided. I specifically started with the smacking, the only conceivable defense from the dire threats, when the police privately questioned me.

Proving the negative (or innocence) is impossible. From my previous experience I understood the police acts first and asks later. I couldn't have proven **not** beating my child to them. They were ready to arrest me, regardless of how much I had denied beating my child. They only stopped when confused about an admitted recent smacking Mother didn't know about.

Once arrested, always arrested. Predatory feminism relies on making seemingly irrefutable accusations. No matter how much a father proves his innocence, he will always be "arrested". Ryan's father was my guiding example: **I was forced to smack my own son to protect both him from the predatory feminists and his father from just getting arrested.**

Fascism builds on systematic terror induced by "we consider you guilty, prove your innocence". Inker's "feminist" divorce strategy is just that: arrest comes easy, and with no risk for the mother, "get him arrested first and then all he does in court is blindly struggle, trying to prove his innocence while we gut him, castrate him, humiliate him, abuse him, destroy him".

## Forced separation... PTSD in children

The children had been living in their father's care for 4 years when the police was called. He was their sole caretaker and they had seen Mother mostly every other weekend. The failed "shock and awe" opening performance had an unfortunate and cruel side-effect: the children were clearly "freaked out about the police being there" as DCF immediately documented it.

Dr. Kurens, a psychiatrist the children were taken to without notice, wrote to Dr. Deutsch *"...it is clear even at this early point...that he meets dsm iv criteria for ADHD and probably does for PTSD as well"*. Kurens flatly declined to respond to or communicate with Father.

While the intended arrest did not happen and the school did not file a complaint, the application for criminal complaint was seemingly still in play for Atty. Otis, as she wrote to the Court *"... therapist has opined that Son has exhibited clear symptoms consistent with... PTSD"**. The Magistrate subsequently dismissed the malicious application with no record.

Meanwhile, Father informed Dr. Deutsch that meeting with the Magistrate would be delayed by the lack of a DCF report. Deutsch delayed the GAL report in turn and eventually left the children to go almost 6 months before allowing physical contact with their Father, despite clear direction from the Court otherwise. The wellbeing of the children was not her concern.

Father wrote under oath: *"Dr. Deutsch also failed to consider that the forced separation of the children from their father could cause extreme stress in the children's lives. The court documented PTSD diagnosis for Son has disappeared once the supervised visitations with Father had started, as his current therapist, Dr. Lawson, denied seeing any signs of PTSD in Son to Father".* The Court seemingly continued to gloss over Dr. Deutsch's cruel actions.

The children's first therapist, Ms. Otis (not Atty.) who was reporting to everyone about PTSD failed to inform Father about the severity of the symptoms, including sudden sleep walking and other new disturbances in the child. The most troubling by an 8 yo boy, "suicidal thoughts" as his Mother noted, were documented in his written psychological evaluation.

On their very first supervised visit, the children immediately and voluntarily told Father all about the scary occurrences of the symptoms. When Father contacted Ms. Otis requesting more information and reminding her about mandated reporting regarding criminal activity (lying to the police at the time), she refused to respond and immediately terminated therapy.

## History of children's medical care

After the separation in 2007, the children were in emotional shock for suddenly "loosing" their mother, as she had left for Hawaii for a month without saying or kissing the 3.5 year olds "good bye". The children were searching for their mother all over the house afterwards. Dr. Deutsch refused to even acknowledge the sad events, never mind document them.

Noticing the symptoms, Father immediately took the children to a therapy center recommended by the pre-school director and Atty. Stamps. The twins stabilized after therapy and, when Mother came back, they promptly resumed seeing and talking to her regularly. The year of the divorce was especially difficult for the twins, and particularly for Father's son.

My son was hospitalized with fever just after the divorce. Dr. Goldsmith, the children's pediatrician, grew concerned and mentioned possible systematic problems. She specifically asked me to keep an eye on their development. During the summer, I had to take my son to the emergency room twice with kidney infections and high, hallucination inducing, fevers.

He was put on strong daily antibiotics (that continued for a year afterwards). He also stopped developing, visibly alarming Dr. Goldsmith, and fell back on all the "growth charts" the doctor kept, to below the 5%-tile. She then initiated systematic, and painful, tests resulting in the discovery of a significant bladder defect and mechanical kidney malfunction.

He was scheduled for surgery in December 2008. Mother in the meantime enjoyed her new freedom and refused to even learn her son's scary diagnosis never mind attending any of the doctor's visits or talking to any of the doctors, not even once! The urologist, Dr. Diamond, commented with sorrow on the lack of the little boy's mother's care, concern or just interest.

The extensive surgery was traumatic for my son. I was with him during his multi-day stay in the hospital. The GAL had no interest in the significant medical history. Dr. Deutsch, with no medical doctor's license, chose to ignore and withhold relevant medical facts from the Court. The apparently inconvenient truth had no place in her dogmatic, scripted narrative.

After the surgery, my son's allergies worsened. The allergist, Dr. Riester, explained that the long-term use of antibiotics could have played a role in this trend. He also urged me to protect the child from more infections and to seek as healthy life-style as possible with lots of fresh air, varied diet and exercise to help drain the mucus and other allergy induced fluids.

During my son's feverish and sickly summer, suddenly moles appeared on his knee. I took him to the referral dermatologist, Dr. Skolnik. The doctor decided that the moles appeared benign and he pointed to the possibility of interplay with the sickness, antibiotics and overall weakness of the child that summer. He urged observation and no irritation of the moles.

Seeking a healthy, outdoorsy and active lifestyle for the children, I made significant changes. Dr. Goldsmith warned about more systematic problems for the "in vitro babies". She even initiated tests for my daughter, as twins likely shared issues. Considering the extreme hardship we experienced, keeping a watchful eye on their development became second nature.

## Medical care invalidated and under siege

By 2011 my focused efforts in caring for my children paid off. We celebrated the second winter with no antibiotics, no infections and no sickness in the family whatsoever. The children came around and they started developing nicely, they were happy, healthy and enjoyed all the outdoor, and indoor, activities, including frequent socializing and friends.

My son's allergies also have stopped spreading, and 2 out of the 3 moles have naturally disappeared and the third one shrank significantly. The happy, good news however did not fit Dr. Deutsch's malicious and unfalsifiable storybook. As apparently the lawsuit was about millions of dollars instead of children, the children were only easy pawns for the professionals.

In addition to her withholding the significant medical history of the children, Dr. Deutsch chose to massively invalidate Father's efforts for caring for his children and to ruthlessly twist it into an "abuse story", where Father would be "obsessed about the children's weights", "force the children to run outside, while he was sickly watching from inside", etc.

Apparently Atty. Otis and the GALs were counting on Father buckling under pressure and avoiding a trial altogether. When he formally requested the children's medical records from the doctors and hospitals, they resorted to forcefully wrangling legal custody away from him. The stakes were getting higher with access to the documentation about their shenanigans.

The Court kept denying the motions for full legal custody for Mother. As per the Inker strategy, they chose to provoke Father. The children were struggling and were getting visibly sick and troubled. When Father approached Dr. Goldsmith about their worsening health, she suddenly refused to even confirm the well documented medical past of the children.

Dr. Goldsmith, a Harvard pediatrician, a medical doctor, just kept repeating to Father: "I will not go to court, I will not go to court, I will not go to court". Instead she chose to allow children to be tortured, medicated and operated on. Father had seen the letters that the lawyers sent her and fully understood the tremendous legal pressure weighing on her.

## Weaponizing a child's oncological surgery

Predictably, the improving mole was picked as the painful torture point. Dr. Goldsmith asked Father every year to revisit that one mole with Dr. Skolnik. And the dermatologist kept urging Father to keep an eye on it, but as the mole had been shrinking, just let it be. He also warned that irritation or a biopsy would result in the required full surgical removal.

As the need for a legal custody "conflict" arose, Dr. Skolnik was avoided. Mother, despite knowing of Father's careful monitoring of the moles, opted to do an immediate full biopsy followed by the required complete removal of the mole. Suddenly all the connected lymph nodes in the child's hip were also removed, resulting in a full blown oncological surgery.

As per the exchanged emails, the plan seemingly had been to provoke a full "resistance and retaliation" from Father for so painfully torturing the child with something that had been successfully dealt with for years before. Understanding the Inker "win-win" strategy, Father did not react as expected, and the Court denied stripping his legal custody once again.

The 2 day surgery at MGH was seemingly not billed to the insurance Father bought for his children. Mother repeatedly confirmed to him that the children were not covered by other plans, copies of which he forwarded to BCBS just as requested. But if a $20-30K hospital bill was not billed to the children's only insurance, then who did pay for it? And why?

## Forced medicating as the "final solution"

As school records indicate, the children's mental and emotional development stalled once again towards the end of the trial. The children's long term therapy, based on apparent lies and seeming collusion with an alleged federal crime, did not bring the "expected" results and the children had to be forcefully medicated after all for acceptable school behavior.

The 4th and last attempt at wrangling legal custody away from Father brought written confirmations from Atty. Otis of the risky side-effects of the drugs the children were made to swallow: liver damage. Father, having collected the necessary documentation, simply refused to collude with an alleged federal crime at the sad expense of his own children.

Father withdrew in writing his consent for the pediatrician, NH therapists and NH psychiatrist to treat his children in collusion with and under the threat of an alleged federal crime. Predictably, this resulted in immediate stripping of his legal custody by the Court and relieving him of his responsibility for knowingly torturing, damaging, harming his children.

## Expectations: defragmenting reality

Father is requesting this honorable Court to order a full and simultaneous investigation into the two matters with the expectation of shedding light on the ongoing conflict between the mothers, the true nature of the existentially damaging child abuse allegations and the systematic hijacking of reality by maliciously minded and bullying "insider" professionals.

Father grew up as persecuted mixed Hungarian minority in Romania during the Ceausescu dictatorship. Psychologically it meant that he would "never get a break", had to adapt faster than the majority, had to recognize "manipulated reality", needed effective self-regulation, had to analyze "patterns of behavior", had no "entitlements", could not be a "victim", etc.

The resilient persecuted minority psyche is best described by "take the good with the bad" mentality. Beaten by the Romanian secret police, Father's family received political asylum in the US. While he suffered and was ultimately treated with ulcer, he is also able to view the events positively: he wouldn't be the proud American citizen he is without the suffering.

## Making $25M from scratch

Ms. Rutland did not have any technical skills. Nor did she have any interest in reading or learning them. As a "savvy", "educated business woman", the Court seemingly perceived her as such, she finally received her bachelor's degree in 2009, after our divorce. But she had an amazing capacity to "convince" people, something that I personally always lacked.

She was quietly let go from Fidelity for seemingly accusing a married, "high-performing" manager with "sexual advances". She approached me after Fidelity for us to work together as I had an "ambitious" software consultancy. I was the boring, but verifiable, "truth". The numerical performance, the software, the facts. And she was the "dream, hype and magical".

She answered the calls: "are you a $10M or a $100M company?", "how many employees?", "who are the investors?". At the time we could barely scrape by in a tiny one-bedroom apartment, with no bed, no furniture, no income, no investments, no name, no support. She applied for 10+ credit cards, all maxed out. My parents, very concerned, loaned us money.

I strategized, designed and wrote the software for the product, documentation and test suites (records of everything produced are available). I also created technical awareness in the community, publicized and marketed the product through technical channels. I enjoyed the technical challenges, the excruciating difficulties. I was horrified by the pain and suffering.

Ms. Rutland had no concept of the value, had no confidence in the performance and had no patience nor the ability to self-regulate regarding the product. After refusing to sell for $200K, $500K, $1M, $2M, as the "milestones" were reached, the company received an offer for $10M at the peak of the dotcom era. She wanted to sell out at all of those price-points.

She was not interested in the technology and only wanted the cash. When I rejected the $10M offer, knowing exactly how the software performed and how it was being viewed in the technical circles, she literally attacked me with a knife. Just 3 weeks later the company received the offer for $25M from another contender. I accepted and sold the company.

## "Take the bad with the good"

Writing the software was pure torture for me: 14 hours of coding a day; feeling exhausted all the time, with disturbed sleeping patterns; bad eating habits; feeling totally burned out and always, always late. One significant part of the software was 6 months late. During that year and a half I had no social life, no sex life, no vacations, no energy to exercise or relax.

Ms. Rutland, always keeping her relationship options "open", still stayed onboard. Having many male partners, she justified chasing after me to NH later, marrying me and taking upon herself the painful process of IVF babies, by claiming "American men are weak" (her favorite derogatory word had been "weak"). I have always wanted to be an "American Man".

Without Ms. Rutland I would not have been able to complete and ship the software. She was strict, incredibly cruel, rigid and always ruthlessly demeaning and derogatory. She called me lazy, idiot, looser, weak (of course), incompetent (for not being able to deliver on time), "a waste of time". And she still uses those same words to describe me to Ms. Woburn.

When we started out I promised her 40% if she would "manage me" through product development. I had already experienced the grueling process behind successful software. Ms. Dean, my manager at Fidelity and a bitter rival of Ms. Rutland's, was the role model in mind. The day before closing the $25M deal I signed 40% of the shares over to Ms. Rutland.

Ms. Rutland and I successfully developed a product and created $25M from scratch in less than 2 years. The factual details and reality had been vastly different from what the Court was led to believe. She was the "hallucination" behind the "dream" of our success, the cruel "slave driver". Without her ruthless bullying I couldn't have tortured myself hard enough.

Father kept meticulous, authenticated and traceable (by trusted third parties) records and controls the technology for accessing them in a safe, protective manner. Links to all those redacted documents will be provided on the website.
