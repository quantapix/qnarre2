## 973 GAL Errors (As A 110 Pages Affidavit)

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker, and on oath deposes and states the following:

I read the report written by Dr. Robin Deutsch, the appointed GAL, 30 times in 8 sessions lasting 2-3 hours each. Since I personally wrote all the documentation and pleadings I submitted to Dr. Deutsch before the interviews, I was quite familiar with both the allegations and my responses. Moreover, I attended the interviews with Dr. Deutsch conscious and acutely aware of what I was saying.

I am a layman and under no circumstances would I attempt to question the expertise of a trained specialist. At the same time, just like anyone else, I understand the suggestive meaning of words, I can spot a contradiction from one page of a plain text to the next, I can tell if key phrases are missing or have been altered, I can tell if I said something or not, I can tell if I said something that was later omitted, I have a sense of fairness and proportion, I can pinpoint bias when talking about everyday events, I can tell when the context of a topic is ignored and, just like everyone else, I can be sensitive to neglect, carelessness, inattention to detail and plain sloppiness.

My claim that Dr. Deutsch's "comprehensive" expert report is biased, incomplete and flawed can only be substantiated with a systematic analysis using a sound and equally comprehensive set of criteria. I used the following criterion to analyze the report. These criterion can and should be understood by anyone and thus no expertise nor special skills are necessary or required to create or to follow the within exposed analysis .

| Criteria        | Description                                | Count   |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------ |
| Omission        | Omitted disclosed relevant information     | 286     |
| Distortion      | Reported in a suggestive and biased manner | 216     |
| Contradiction   | Failed to note inconsistency or conflict   | 189     |
| Isolation       | Refused to consider relevant context       | 166     |
| Fairness        | Refused to seek out both sides of an issue | 70      |
| Negligence      | Reported in a careless manner              | 41      |
| Proportionality | Failed to report in a proportional manner  | 5       |
|                 | **Total**                                  | **973** |

The rest of this document is cryptic both intentionally and by necessity. Under no circumstances did I want to violate the strict rules prohibiting the copying of a full sentence or paragraph from a GAL report. Hence I only quoted a minimum number of words from a sentence just enough to locate that sentence in the report.

This document is also cryptic for shortness sake. The GAL report is skillfully crafted and it is very long indeed. The carefully orchestrated suggestive meaning of its sentences seamlessly and authoritatively lead to the rigid conclusion of the report. I could not hope to be convincing of the report's bias and overall flawed nature without documenting a large enough set of key sentences or "points" with demonstrated questionable validity.

The 339 or so such key sentences are listed in the numbered sequence they appear in the report. Each is then followed by a set of its observed "flaws" through a respective set of characterizing criterion defined above. Most often these flaws are followed by direct references to documents filed with the court and/or submitted to Dr. Deutsch. For convenience and readability, the relevant paragraphs from those documents are also pasted therein.

Quotes that are marked with "interview" are what I remember having told Dr. Deutsch during the interviews. Abbreviated sentences from the report starting with a person's initial in brackets "[]" are what that person "reported" to Dr. Deutsch as per the report. All other quoted sentences are Dr. Deutsch's observations and statements from the report

## Filed Motion To Vacate Dr. Deutsch's GAL Report

**NOW COMES** the Defendant, Andreas Laker (the "Father"), and respectfully requests that this Honorable Court vacate the report submitted by Dr. Robin Deutsch from this case. Dr Deutsch was appointed the Guardian ad Litem in the parallel custody case.

As grounds for the within motion, Father states as follows:

1. Father filed motions on 5-25-2011 requesting the appointment of a psychologist GAL with an extended scope to investigate the behavioral dynamics among Father, the Plaintiff (Ms. Woburn) and the Plaintiff of the above parallel case (Ms. Rutland).

2. This Honorable Court allowed the motions and appointed Dr. Harry Somers on 7-13-2011 to act as the GAL and to investigate and report on the issues surrounding this case.

3. On 9-14-2011, Honorable J. Donnelly allowed the Plaintiff's motion requesting the counsel and the GALs in both cases to have access and read each other's GAL reports (Exhibit 1).

4. Dr. Somers submitted his report on 11-17-2011. The report is comprehensive, complete, balanced and fair. Dr. Somers visited both parents' homes, observed the children interact with their parents, contacted and interviewed all relevant parties (including Ms. Rutland), read and considered all timely submitted documentation, emails and other communications.

5. Dr. Deutsch completed her investigation of the "complex" case virtually at the same time as Dr. Somers (Exhibit 2). Both professionals were exposed to the same people, same contacts, same facts, all at the same time.

6. The two GAL reports, however, cannot be any more different in their observations, diagnoses and recommendations. A possible reason for the significant discrepancy could be Father's repeated claim through his counsel in Honorable J. Donnelly's court that Dr. Deutsch's report is biased, incomplete and flawed.

7. During her investigation, Dr. Deutsch a) never noted that the children were in their Father's sole care for the preceding 4 years yet reported that they were "very healthy, charming and intelligent", b) never visited the Father's and children's home of 7 years yet reported about their environment, toys, etc., c) never observed Father with children yet reported about children's emotions toward their Dad, d) never contacted the children's coaches and activities teachers yet reported about their exercise regimens, e) never considered new school policies and "healthy" practices yet reported about Father's caring and feeding of the children, f) never contacted Ms. Woburn yet used her emails as key evidence in the report, etc. Father has prepared his "Affidavit Questioning Dr. Deutsch's Report" entirely on his own as a systematic and comprehensive rebuttal, documenting over 700 flaws in Dr. Deutsch's report.

8. Dr. Deutsch reported that "the lack of affect on Ms. Rutland's part could be a result of lack of care and concern for the children ... she has sought at least joint custody ... only accepted less ... after being "bullied" by Mr. Laker" during their divorce. The bullying allegation, while seemingly a crucial aspect of the case, was never questioned nor verified by Dr. Deutsch.

9. Neither was Ms. Rutland's claim that Father "refused" to allow the children to receive therapy during the divorce and that Father expressed his belief that counseling is for the "weak". Father informed Dr. Deutsch that he had taken the children to therapy with Ms. Rutland's consent. Dr. Deutsch never contacted the therapist and never questioned Ms. Rutland as to why she hadn't personally participated in the children's therapy. The "bullied" mother allegedly was "very concerned" for her children at the time (Exhibit 3).

10. Both Dr. Deutsch and Dr. Somers have been informed that Father had been and continues to be in successful treatment with Dr. Mark Goldblatt. Dr. Goldblatt is Dr. Deutsch's fellow Harvard professor and MGH clinical psychiatrist colleague. Dr. Goldblatt was recommended by Dr. von Broembsen, whom Dr. Deutsch extensively relied upon when she claimed in her report that "Mr. Laker will not be amenable to mental health treatment".

11. As per Dr. Goldblatt's comment to Father, Dr. Deutsch, a licensed psychologist, should have at least mandated therapy for Ms. Rutland in her report either for "lack of affect" for her children OR for being "bullied" into giving up her 3 yo children to a "cruel abuser" without filing a single motion in court or asking for mediation or for the services of a GAL.

12. Most importantly, Dr. Deutsch stopped at mandating supervised visitations "indefinitely" and that "Ms. Rutland retain decision making responsibility". Dr. Deutsch did not provide room in her report for mistakes in her reporting, for her overlooked twisted realities nor for improvements. She did not provide a roadmap for normalizing relations nor for healing and instead **mandated forced and immediate abandonment of the children by their Father**. Encouraged by Dr. Deutsch's rigid diagnosis, Ms. Rutland has since demanded 1 hour supervised visitations **per month** and stripping Father's joint legal custody (Exhibit 4).

13. Nevertheless, Father has embraced Dr. Deutsch's recommendations and has been following her suggestions. Dr. Deutsch now states that Father "needs to treat with someone who is not only a psychiatrist" and requested Father to treat with Dr. Alexandra Harrison (Exhibit 5).

14. Father has voluntarily chosen to take a proactive and cooperating approach, agreeing essentially to all requests and recommendations by all involved professionals. He has been visiting weekly with all 4 of his children at MSPCC Lowell since the fall. The weekly supervised visitations have been progressing wonderfully, with the center's staff having no complaints against nor concerns with Father's conduct with his children (MSPCC Reports).

15. On 1-10-2012, Honorable J. Donnelly had to request "triggering events" from Dr. Deutsch for the normal progression from successful supervised visitations. She has responded with requirements easily opposed and delayed by mother (Exhibit 6). Regardless, Father is committed to please the professionals and continues to abide by both GAL's requirements.

16. Dr. Somers' report is decidedly more practical and useful as it outlines a roadmap to normalize the parenting relationship between the parties. The report establishes clear milestones and defines triggering events for evaluating the progress the parties must achieve in order to assure a loving, caring and balanced nurturing environment for their children.

17. Father has gladly adopted Dr. Somers' guidance and, with Dr. Somers' approval, engaged Dr. Harrison as his personal therapist and parenting coach in this case as well, after Dr. Harrison had confirmed her availability to report to the Court about Father's progress (Exhibit 7).

18. The centerpiece of Dr. Deutsch's report is a recording started by Ms. Woburn without Father's knowledge on 2-20-2010 and emailed to Ms. Rutland the same day. In the recording Father can be heard yelling at his son Leon. One could interpret other sounds as "hitting sounds".

19. Father has admitted yelling at his son during the recording. He has denied hitting his son however. The day after the recording was made, Father drove up to NH to pick the children up from Ms. Rutland as their visitation had ended. At that time Ms. Rutland confirmed with Leon that Father had not hit him and Ms. Rutland released the children to Father with the condition that Father cease all contact with Ms. Woburn (and his 7 mo son). The children's every other weekend visitation schedule with Ms. Rutland continued as usual afterwards.

20. Father has deeply regretted yelling at his child and has been making every effort imaginable to amend and to repair that great mistake. However, as Ms. Rutland had threatened during that pickup, she has used the recording frequently to blackmail Father and to force him to act against his baby son with Ms. Woburn, lest the recording would have been brought to the police. Ms. Rutland has threatened Father 16 times since Ms. Woburn's first pregnancy.

21. On 4-26-2011, when Ms. Woburn sent an email to Ms. Rutland, Father knew that he ran out of options as Ms. Woburn made direct reference to the recording and to the fact that Ms. Rutland had been "ignoring" the recording for more than a year (Exhibit 8). Father couldn't have been sure if Ms. Rutland was taking the recording to the police first or not. He also couldn't have known that the Plaintiffs had started collaborating against Father (Exhibit 9).

22. Ms. Woburn had been threatening Father with the recording just as much by repeatedly telling Father that "your twins will be taken to foster care should you refuse to satisfy my needs". It is clear now from her above email and her filed court documents that she was planning to use the recording against Father as her second pregnancy was ending in the spring of 2011.

23. Despite Ms. Woburn's filed allegations against Father, Dr. Deutsch also reported about Ms. Woburn hitting her other son Steve: "Steve would cry. She hit him in the same places".

24. The numerous emails Father sent simultaneously to both mothers after the recording was made are proof of Father's extreme fear and desperate struggle to appease both mothers' blackmailing while still not abandoning nor intentionally ignoring any of his children.

25. Once Father learned in court that Ms. Rutland had submitted the recording to the authorities before Ms. Woburn had the opportunity, Father immediately asked Dr. Deutsch to give him a chance to talk about the root cause of Father's seemingly and admittedly erratic actions and emails and about his "crazy" sustained contact with Ms. Woburn (Exhibit 10).

26. Dr. Deutsch never provided the opportunity to Father to talk about the recording. There also seems to be a confusion about her authority to listen to the recording (Exhibit 11).

27. Dr. Deutsch also failed to properly observe the facts behind Ms. Rutland's claim that "Mr. Laker would fight until there was not a dime left". While Father expressed in detail his very difficult emotional situation and that Ms. Rutland was fully aware of how desperate Father had also been financially just before she started the court action, Dr. Deutsch still concluded that Father "appeared" to be distressed "from ongoing factors ... not solely situational or temporary". In fact Father told her repeatedly that he had not been in a more hopeless situation in his life and he simply didn't know at the time how to get out of it (Exhibit 12)

28. Since Dr. Deutsch's rigid and biased report is the source of contention in both cases, going to trials seems inevitable. Father simply cannot abandon his children as mandated by Dr. Deutsch and mothers can only ignore the report by the leading GAL at their own peril.

29. Dr. Deutsch has billed over \$22,000 for her services in the case (Exhibit 13) and the report guarantees doubling her pay by forcing both cases to trials with her as the principal expert.

30. As Ms. Rutland immediately exposed the recording to the police, a hearing was scheduled early on for an application for criminal complaint. Both Plaintiffs started referring to the "ongoing" criminal investigation in their pleadings in court (Exhibit 14). However, the Clerk Magistrate denied issuing an application for criminal complaint after learning about the ongoing dual threats and blackmailings against Father.

31. Not seeing his children for 6 months combined with an almost hopeless financial situation along with forced dual custody trials and a false criminal investigation would make any father depressed. Being utterly invalidated by a biased report was added cruel torturing.

32. In order to pay for Dr. Deutsch's deposition and to have at least a chance against being forcefully excluded from his children's lives, Father has been forced to short sell his house, his only asset at the time, at a loss in excess of \$1,700,000. And at less than what he paid Ms. Rutland for her half just over 3 years before, during their divorce (Exhibit 15).

33. Dr. Deutsch also failed to consider that the forced separation of the children from their father could cause extreme stress in the children's lives. The court documented PTSD diagnosis for Leon (Exhibit 16) has disappeared once the supervised visitations with Father had started, as his current therapist, Dr. Loralie Lawson, denied seeing any signs of PTSD in Leon to Father.

34. As the recording is now exposed and Father is fully complying with the professional's requests and recommendations to rebuild his loving relationships with all of his children, the excruciating fear from threats and blackmailings has ended and lessons have been learned. There is no imaginable reason nor desire on Father's part to return to any relationship with either Plaintiff, other than simply being the respectful parents of their respective children.

35. The mothers nevertheless have been encouraged by Dr. Deutsch's report to continue to express outrageous allegations. The children have been reported to have eating disorders (without any professional confirming the diagnosis), the children and moms have been reportedly "scared" of supervised visitations (without supervisors ever observing that) and the moms even accused the center of "refusing" to give them their reports (without them ever asking for the reports) (Exhibit 17).

**WHEREFORE** Father respectfully moves this Honorable Court to vacate from this case the report submitted by Dr. Robin Deutsch, the appointed GAL in the parallel custody case.

Respectfully submitted,

## Year+ Old Doctored Recording Used To Deceive The Court

Dear Dr. Deutsch,

There was a court hearing on August 8. Abigail's attorney told the Court that you were provided with a copy of the DCF report, as well as a recording. I have just had the opportunity to read the DCF report. Since we did not talk about either of these items, I wanted to provide you with my perspective. I am happy to meet, if you feel it is appropriate, to talk about these and any other items.

### DCF Report

- The children have always been excited about school. They never complained to me about anyone hurting them in school, nor was there ever a call from the school saying that either Lisa or Leon had been hurt by anyone. Consistent with my observations, Leon's interview in the report starts with:

  ```python
  "... Leon told worker that he is 7 years old and he is in the 1st grade at the Thoreau School, and he said that things are good at school..."
  ```

  However, it was raised in Court that the children are (were) being bullied at school. Following the Court hearing, Leon told me on the phone last week that he didn't want to be in his class anymore because Carter hurts him. Then, Lisa told me that she didn't miss her best friend Mia anymore because Mia had been very bossy. This is the first time either of the children have said anything like this to me. They were previously telling me that they did not want to go to school in New Hampshire. I am concerned about these new reports, made during the summer when the children have not even been in contact with these other children.

- I need to point out that in Ms. Mahoney's observations in the report, the "he stated that there was physical disciplining" should read "he stated that there was NO physical disciplining".

  ```python
  "... Father stated that on the day of the reported incident, he yelled at Leon to pay attention and he told him to eat his breakfast, and he stated that there was physical disciplining..."
  ```

  This correction would be consistent with the police report, all my filed motions and affidavits as well as Ms. Mahoney's own first sentence in the same paragraph:

  ```python
  "... Father stated that he did not hurt Leon on the day of the reported incident..."
  ```

  And two sentences down:

  ```python
  "... Father said that nothing happened at breakfast, as reported. He said that on Thursday mother was with the children and then the school called..."
  ```

- A significant inconsistency in Leon's recalling of the events on that Thursday morning is apparent between what he said to the police:

  ```python
  "... father began yelling at him that he needed to eat. He stated that he didn't really want to eat his breakfast. Leon then started crying, and told me that his father then hit him in the face. I asked him if his father had hit him with a fist (like a punch) or an open hand (like a slap)."

  "He stated that he had slapped him and pointed to the right side of his face. I asked him how many times his father had hit him, and he stated 'I think three.' I did not observe any physical signs of injury, either to the side of his face or inside his mouth. I asked him if he was hurt, and he stated it still hurt a little, but that he didn't need a doctor..."
  ```

  And what he told the DCF reporter just a few days later:

  ```python
  "... not living with father because father kept hitting him and he would cry. Leon explained that he does not like oatmeal so on the day of the reported incident, he wasn't eating, so father got mad and he 'slammed' his head on he table, causing his forehead to hit the table, which he said, hurt."

  "He said that he wasn't certain if he had a bruise at the time and worker did not see bruising. Leon said that he has a small bump on the top of his head from when father hit him with his knuckles and his fist a couple times and he said that it hurt..."
  ```

  Just a few days later, while in mother's exclusive care, Leon's statements to the DCF worker grew to a "father hits him almost every day".

  ```python
  "... Leon then said that father hits him almost every day with his hand or his fist when he is mad, when he doesn't like the food..."
  ```

- The children and I have been running around the house on weekday mornings for the last 2 years as exercise and to start off the day with an energizing activity. There were mornings when the children had fever. There were 2 incidents of vomiting during that time period. But the children never had to run when they had fever (or were otherwise sick). And they never vomited because of running.

  ```python
  "... that he is nervous to go home if he does not finish his launch."

  "Lisa's teacher said that in the winter Lisa said that they have to run laps every morning and although Leon had a fever, he still needed to run and then he vomited. She said that father gives the kids math work to..."
  ```

- I don't throw things around the house and I **never** made anyone eat vomit.

### Recording

The recording was made a year and a half ago. Abigail has had it in her possession since the day after it was made and has used it to try to make demands of me. I did yell at Leon, but I did not hit Leon. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you further to explain the circumstances of the recording, at your convenience.

Sincerely,

### "I am unable to access the email exchange"

## "Sleepless Night" (Flashbacks Of The Romanian Secret Police)

My Dear Therapist,

After Friday's very stressful and combative deposition, I had a very difficult time sleeping. I feel that I would like to talk about my answers with you, and my therapists, since it looks like the answers were "evasive" and **I will be compelled by the judge to answer them "differently" shortly**.

One exchange particularly sticks out as troubling for me. I was asked under oath if I believed that Leon was scared of me. I responded that "no, I don't believe that". Then I was forced to read a paragraph from Dr. Deutsch's report essentially reporting that Leon had told Dr. Deutsch that he was very scared of me. Unfortunately I was quickly interrupted and wasn't allowed to finish my sentence regarding what I believe Dr. Deutsch reported.

I wanted to state that I have very valid reasons to believe that **Dr. Deutsch was not truthful in her report**. What she stated about my mother on page 23 was a complete fabrication, despite the 15-20 minutes I spent with Dr. Deutsch and Dr. Olezeski explaining how my mother, my sister and I came together to the US in 1986 and that my mother started working with my father, on the same floor, at Brigham and Women's Hospital in 1987. She retired from the same place in 2004.

I was very clear to Dr. Deutsch that, after the family being separated for 4 years during the immigration, my mother and father essentially worked together for 17 years and they retired together at the same time. I also told Dr. Deutsch that my mother has authored numerous research publications form Harvard, that can be easily verified with a simple google search for "Sarah Laker". I also went into great detail about how my parents always drove together to work and, while they worked for different groups, they always collaborated, something that I have always admired. And I vividly remember that I had emphasized this because this was the pattern I did with Abigail as well.

When Dr. Deutsch was asked about why she made a false statement about my mother, she dismissed it as an unimportant detail during her deposition. How can I believe then that my son would say those horrible things about his father? That he doesn't want to see his father? Especially after seeing him voluntarily hug me week after week.

But now in light of all my depression, suffering and sleepless nights, I need to find an answer to **why a licensed psychologist would willingly falsify my relationship with my mother**. The "unimportant detail" answer doesn't make sense because Dr. Deutsch did not have to write anything about my mother. She instead went ahead and, without even calling my mother (she had my parents' numbers), she simply wrote a blatant and easily refutable lie. She didn't have to interview me for that. She didn't have to ask so many questions about my mother for that. And she "reported" that I said all that about my mother.

I am really bothered by this because I have to meet Dr. Deutsch again and I feel that I have to write everything down before I talk to her. I am now vividly recalling the Romanian Secret Police how they tried to force me to give them an answer they could use. At the end, they still wrote down what I gave them and punished me for it.

But Dr. Deutsch did something far more hurtful in my view. She went ahead and wrote down a cruel lie about my mother. Now I am starting to understand my inner conflict being tied to my naive concept that my children's moms have to be fundamentally good, and this horribly painful act on Dr. Deutsch's part is hurting even more.

She wanted to forcefully take away my "good" mother and intentionally wanted to invalidate my entire existence just so that her report could be supported. I simply cannot explain this in any other way from a Court-appointed, licensed psychologist. And now I am forced by the court to talk to this person again, just so that she can reiterate her findings that my children should be kept away from me, while they themselves reportedly have suicidal thoughts.

Something is very wrong here and I feel that I need help. Of course, I am disciplined, just as before in my life, and I will suppress my feelings and will talk to Dr. Deutsch in a very civilized manner. But I have to document my feelings, emotions and thoughts ahead of time, so that I feel safe from Dr. Deutsch altering what I say once again.

Otherwise I feel calm and rational. And under no circumstances will I be angry or emotional with Dr. Deutsch.

Thank you again for your efforts and your time,
