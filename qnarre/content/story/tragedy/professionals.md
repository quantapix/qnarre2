# Professionals Colluding With Child Abuse

{@a top}

## Dear Detective

Since my previous letter to you I have learned that as the father I can simply request the full report from DCF. Now that I have a copy I am sending it to you as per your request.

In my defense I would like to point out the following:

1. On page 10 of the report it is concluded that:

  ```python
  "This report has been unsupported for the physical abuse of Leon by father since there is no known bruising."
  ```

1. A significant inconsistency in Leon's recalling of the events on that Thursday morning is apparent between what he said to the police on page 4:

  ```python
  "... father began yelling at him that be needed to eat. He stated that he didn't really want to eat his breakfast. Leon then started crying, and told me that his father then hit him in the face. I asked him if his father had hit him with a fist (like a punch) or an open hand (like a slap)."

  "He stated that he had slapped him and pointed to the right side of his face. I asked him how many times his father had hit him, and be stated 'I think three.' I did not observe any physical signs of injury, either to the side of his face or inside his mouth. I asked him if he was hurt, and he stated it still hurt a little, but that he didn't need a doctor..."
  ```

  and what he told the DCF reporter just a few days later on page 2:

  ```python
  "... not living with father because father kept hitting him and he would cry. Leon explained that he does not like oatmeal so on the day of the reported incident, he wasn't eating, so father got mad and he 'slammed' his head on he table, causing his forehead to hit the table, which he said, hurt."

  "He said that he wasn't certain if he had a bruise at the time and worker did not see bruising. Leon said that he has a small bump on the top of his head from when father hit him with his knuckles and his fist a couple times and he said that it hurt..."
  ```

1. On page 4 of the report Leon said this to the police:

  ```python
  "... I asked Leon if this was the first time his father had hit him, and he said no. I asked him to tell me about other incidents."

  "He didn't say anything at first, but his mother prompted him, saying 'What about the salad bowl?' Leon began crying, and then stated to me that his father was upset at him and dumped a salad bowl on his head."

  "I asked how long ago this occurred, and Rutland stated that she thought it happened about a month ago. I asked Leon if he was scared of his father, and he stated 'Yes' and started crying again..."
  ```

  and just a few days later, while in mother's exclusive care, Leon's statements to the DCF worker grew to a "father hits him almost every day" on page 2.

  ```python
  "... Leon then said that father hits him almost every day with his hand or his fist when he is mad, when he doesn't like the food..."
  ```

1. I need to mention that the children have had daily uncensored, unmonitored and free contact with their mother for the last 4 years as can be seen from the also attached phone records. Had such beatings taken place they should have been noticed much earlier.

1. On page 7 of the report Ms. Mahoney's "he stated that there was physical disciplining" observation should read "he stated that there was NO physical disciplining".

  ```python
  "... Father stated that on the day of the reported incident, he yelled at Leon to pay attention and he told him to eat his breakfast, and he stated that there was physical disciplining..."
  ```

  This correction would be consistent with a) the police report on page 5:

  ```python
  "... We brought Andreas inside to confront him with the allegations. He denied striking his child in any way this nmorning..."
  ```

  b) Ms. Mahoney's own first sentence in the same paragraph on page 6:

  ```python
  "... Father stated that he did not hurt Leon on the day of the reported incident..."
  ```

  and c) two sentences down:

  ```python
  "... Father said that nothing happened at breakfast, as reported. He said that on Thursday mother was with thenchildren and then the school called..."
  ```

1. I am also attaching the mother's denied motion to immediately remove the children from the state alleging that:

  ```python
  "... The Plaintiff volunteered regularly at the children's school and spoke often to the children's teachers. The children's teachers NEVER reported any concerns to the Plaintiff."

  "In addition, even after Leon reported his concerns about going home and that his father had slapped him, the school sent the children home with the Defendant, and they failed to report any incidents to DCF."

  "THE PLAINTIFF DOES NOT FEEL THAT THE CONCORD SCHOOL SYSTEM IS AN APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILDREN AS THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL FAILED TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN OR FILE REPORTS AS MANDATED REPORTERS."

  "In addition. the Defendant has now provided the school personnel with several inappropriate e-mails which, if the content were released to the children, would cause them serious emotional harm..."
  ```

  My response to those allegations against the school my children love so much is also attached:

  ```python
  "... The children's teachers never reported any concerns about the children because there were no concerns. I had daily contact with the teachers and have been attentive and responsive to any issues that might have come up."

  "Abigail insinuating that both teachers would simultaneously ignore signs of child abuse along with the social worker, school psychologist and principal ready and willing to hide such evidence from state officials is baseless and meant only to serve her efforts to remove the children from Massachusetts..."
  ```

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

## "Expert" Forensic Psychology Report By Harvard Instructor

... The forensic mental health professions have long been concerned about professional performance in custody cases in particular. Thus, the conclusion of Defendant's export to the effect that that there is "no justification" for denying the Defendant unsupervised visits with his children is highly disconcerting, given that Defendant's expert did not interview or even request to interview the Plaintiff, an omission that appears to conflict with the ethical guidelines of his profession, as follows:

_"In custody cases, honesty and objectivity require that all parties be interviewed, if possible, before an opinion is rendered. When this is not possible, or is not done for any reason, this should be clearly indicated in the forensic psychiatrist's report and testimony. If one parent has not been interviewed, even after deliberate effort, it may be inappropriate to comment on that parent's fitness as a parent. Any comments on the fitness of a parent who has not been interviewed should be qualified and the data for the opinion clearly indicated"_ [Ethical Guidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, May 2005].

In fact, the Plaintiff possesses highly pertinent information about the Defendant's parental functioning in general and his purported upbringing and experiences under the Romanian government.

In sum, the recommendation by Defendant's expert to the effect that the GAL evaluation should be rendered unreliable actually reflects what must be concluded about the expert's own evaluation - i.e., it is unreliable and must be disregarded.

Defendant's expert seemingly failed to abide by the professional protocols and ethical guidelines of forensic mental health practice, and his opinions do not appear to reflect the database, given the number and magnitude of facts that are ignored.

**Obviously, the stakes in this case are very high, since the allegations against the Defendant are extremely serious. Leon is reportedly exhibiting indicia of psychological disturbance, and Lisa is reportedly exhibiting emotional maladjustment. Thus, the importance of competent professional expertise would seem critical to the wellbeing of the minor children in this case.**

### "Troubling He Was The Gal For 500 Cases"

Dear Erin (Atty. Harris),

Here is my draft analysis of Dr. Daignault's report. As I indicate in the concluding sections, it is remarkable that he takes such a "freeze-time" or "snapshot" approach to evaluation, which leaves out the developmental perspective with respect to both Andreas's potential for development and the children's developmental paths and needs (and risk of lost opportunities). In light of his developmental tone-deafness, **I find it troubling that he was the GAL for 500 cases**.

As you see fit, you can submit this analysis (with revisions as needed) as a formal document in support of a motion to exclude Dr. Daignault's report and testimony and/or use it as a basis for cross-examining him. I also wrote it as a template for outlining some underlying themes of this case in whatever contexts they may appear, including addressing Dr. Kivisto's report and cross-examining Abigail. I hope you will find it useful in that way as well.

Having laid out this material in some detail here, I will turn to adapting some of it for an analysis (briefer, I hope) of the unreliability of Dr. Kivisto's conclusions in light of his new data.

At your convenience, please let me know what you think of the attached.
Best,

## Dear Teacher

I have exchanged further emails with Abigail, and to my surprise she seems to indicate "a teacher's concern for possible ADHD" (I am attaching the email chain for your information). I am surprised of this because you emailed me about Leon just a week or so before the above emails and your email didn't mention any concerns about Leon. Clearly, I have no idea what was exchanged between you and Abigail and I certainly would not want to make any assumptions.

I still feel the need to write to you because I am greatly concerned about my son and I would like to urge you, along with all the other professional caretakers, to have a little bit more patience with the little boy. Just as I told you in person, Leon has gone through an inordinate amount of forced changes in the last two years. He was taken from my custody with false beating allegations. Immediately after he was referred to a therapist in Westford who diagnosed him with PTSD in publicly filed court documents. He was also referred to a local psychiatrist who after an hour visit with him wanted to put him on medication for ADHD (the doctor subsequently refused to talk to me after I fulfilled her request for court documents).

### Biased, flawed and incomplete GAL report

Then a GAL investigation by a mere psychologist with no regard to medical facts further polarized the situation with a biased, hopelessly flawed and utterly incomplete report. The report failed to even note Leon's previous therapy sessions due to him suddenly loosing his mother at the age of 3.5 yo (not surprisingly Abigail refused to attend any of those therapy sessions with us). By the end of the GAL investigation Leon was already trying to get used to a new school and a new therapist (the one in Westford was "no good" anymore for Abigail when I attracted the therapist's attention to Leon's self-reported, repeated sleep-walking sessions at night when, according to Lisa, Abigail would just "yell at him").

The new therapist, Dr. Lawson, completely ruled out PTSD, ADD, ADHD and such and started a now year and a half long therapy with Leon. Even a formal psychological evaluation was done last spring to support the therapist's views, squarely blaming the father for all his son's hardships. Leon's second grade teacher, Mrs. Udice, also ruled out PTSD, ADHD, ADD and such and maintained that Leon needs a loving, caring and calm environment. In order to provide that, I exchanged emails with the teacher on a weekly basis regarding Leon's activities and progress and provided as much support as I possibly could to help my son. Needless to say, Leon's report card improved steadily and by the end of the year he became his teacher's pride. Unfortunately, Leon was yanked out of a finally stabilized environment once again and was convinced to immediately turn against that school and his teacher in NH. Even more, last August during the still ongoing trial I was accused of having an "improper" relationship with Mrs. Udice and that she was "drinking father's cool-aid". The fact is that Leon was forced to attend three different schools in a school year.

### Fabricated supervised "whispering" allegations

In the meantime Leon was put into a situation where he had a reportedly "good time" with his father during a supervised visitation celebrating his own birthday, yet was forced ("tell Roberta what you told me" Abigail reportedly urged him) to turn against his father, whom he had voluntarily kissed and hugged just seconds earlier, to falsely accuse me of "whispering" and "scaring him". Lisa, who had always been right besides his brother, flatly refused to confirm such wrong-doings as the supervised visitation monitor testified last November. Due to these "impossible" whispering allegations, the supervised visitation center was attacked so ferociously by Abigail that they felt the need to retain an attorney. Even the judge expressed disbelief and repeatedly refused to rule about the "whispering incident" and twice denied Abigail's attempt at changing visitation centers.

Then the new school year started in Westford and Leon's then temporary teacher never once complained about his behavior. At the end of last December, when I met you after you had just returned to Leon's classroom, I only heard praise of my son. Even when I expressed concern about Leon so easily turning against his former schools, friends, teachers, etc. (even against Mrs. Conlin, do you remember?), the behavior pattern was flatly dismissed. And now, after you only knowing Leon for roughly a month, he should be evaluated for ADHD? It is hard to take you seriously (if Abigail's emails are true) considering all the other professionals who have been looking after Leon.

Nevertheless, I do take you very seriously. I am very concerned about my son, and not because of ADHD. I don't agree with how this is playing out but, as my only option, I did contact Leon's therapist last month about my concerns about his behavior patterns, the seemingly unbelievable pressure that my little boy is under and about the fact that all along his very serious and life-threatening past medical conditions had been completely ignored. Dr. Lawson flatly refused to listen to my concerns and, as usual, blamed Leon's hardships on me (she even wrote me a letter blatantly taking sides in this 2 year-long bitter, three-way, dual-lawsuit, million dollar court battle between her patient's parents). Unfortunately, while I can take the stress as a 51 yo adult, my poor 8 yo little boy cannot and seemingly, in my own opinion, is starting to fall apart under the pressure of the wildly fractured and cruelly forced realities around him. And as Abigail is stating "... You run around trying to dig up crap instead of actually getting any treatment for your behavior that got all of us into this mess. You cannot even admit you hit Leon constantly and screamed at both Lisa and Leon all the time. But the kids have not forgotten. And probably never will...", peace seems very elusive for Leon as is because those allegations are simply not true.

### "Mere psychologist who can prescribe pills"

I also contacted Leon's long-term pediatrician, Dr. Goldsmith, last December and asked her to consider referring Leon to a specialist psychiatrist, as per the advice I had received from the three highly regarded, Harvard affiliated psychiatrists who had evaluated and treated me for the last 2 years. However, Dr. Goldsmith also flatly declined my request, saying that Leon is "perfectly healthy" and that there is no need for a psychiatrist, who is nothing more than a "mere psychologist who can prescribe pills". Considering Leon's completely disregarded and very serious medical history and my unfortunately extensive personal experience with both psychologists and psychiatrists, I have no choice but to reiterate my plea to Dr. Goldsmith for a full psychiatric evaluation for Leon by a specialist psychiatrist, a medical doctor by training and expertise.

Further complicating matters for my son, just two weeks ago we also had to switch visitation centers because of the old center closing due to the poor economy. I am not sure that Abigail mentioned it to you, but she had claimed that Leon had a very difficult time with that recent change as well. I know from my personal experience that this surreal and infinitely protracted adversarial situation is extremely difficult to handle even for us adults and I can only imagine the toll it must take on the children.

Moreover, the expert specialist psychiatrists openly confirmed that the developmental window for the children will close soon and supervised visitations (with no incidents whatsoever during the more than 200 combined visits with all of my children) were never designed to go on for such long periods. Unfortunately I cannot change the minds of the Dr. Lawsons and as long as even Dr. Goldsmith casually claims that my children will have to be in therapy "for their lives" and that she "cannot recommend" me seeing my children without supervision, I simply cannot help my son by any means other than writing this letter. Also, I simply cannot risk exposing myself to further false accusations that are impossible to defend myself from as long as the realities remain so wildly fractured and unverified.

Thank you for caring for my son and thank you in advance for your patience with my little boy.

Best Regards,

## A Bullied Pediatrician

Dear Dr. Goldsmith,

As you are aware of the turn of events in the lives of my twins, Lisa & Leon, I feel the need to update you with the most recent developments.

First of all, DCF sent out a revised report on May 18, 2011 dropping the previously alleged "physical abuse" charge against me. Second, the judge assigned to Abigail's case clarified yesterday that I still had half legal custody of the twins. As such, I would like to reiterate my position regarding on-going medical treatments: **I have not been notified nor have I approved any ongoing medical treatments on my children**. I am specifically referring to regular psychological therapy that the children have been undergoing since April 28, 2011, according to their mother's attorney.

I also need to note that just 2 weeks prior to the attempted arrest of their father by their mother in front of the children, Leon's teacher, Mrs. Walsh, was raving to me about his nice development, visible improvements, excellent academic performance and overall happiness in our scheduled parent/teacher conference on April 12, 2011.

I need to emphasize that prior to April 28 there were no reasons or need for the children to undergo any medical treatments. Their mother never complained, their teachers were all satisfied and happy with their progress and behavior. Moreover, just over a month before, my son Leon won a silver medal at the regional swimming championship in Boston against 50+ other boys in his age group on March 12, 2011.

**Since April 28, the attempted arrest snowballed into a multi-custody/support case with a criminal twist [false rape allegations] by Alessia also jumping in within days after Abigail's start.** There are 3 judges and 2 psychiatrist Guardian Ad Litems appointed now to weighing the dispute. DCF is naturally actively involved as well. School officials have also been extensively briefed. Both mothers are simultaneously seeking sole custody, only limited supervised visitation and a hefty child support, because the father is "well off".

Dear Doctor, you as the medical caretaker of all of my children, who also was/is taking care of Ryan and Steve, the mothers' other children, please advise me about the medical procedures and treatments my children are undergoing. For your reference, I am including all the public court documents that have been filed by the parties in the cases so far. I have also included my supporting documentation that is extensively cross-referenced in my own court motions. Of course, I don't expect you to read all the lengthy back-and-forth exchanges.

However, I simply cannot afford to defend myself on so many fronts at the same time. Especially considering that I have spent in excess of $100K in legal fees over the last 4 years to protect myself from the never ending provocation/punishment cycles leveled at me. My only choice in my goal of clearing my name and reestablishing psychical custody of my twins is to have a unified defense strategy: by using the exact same documentation and being 100% transparent in all of my communications.

**I also need to note that Alessia unsuccessfully tried to use the letter you wrote on Steve's behalf in the fall of 2009.** In court she cited your letter with the objective to have a restraining order granted to "protect" my baby son Luke from me.

I would have to assume that at the time Alessia brought Steve in for you to observe, she did not mention that school officials and DCF had been already notified of her threatening my daughter Lisa with a knife in my house and in front of all the children. While never questioning the correctness of your observations, I have to assure you that all children and adults were equally scared at the time.

It is needless to say that I am very concerned about what is happening to all of my children.

Sincerely,

### "Your Son Will Never Speak Properly"

Dear Dr. Goldsmith,

I have tried to reach out to you to allay my fears and concerns about my son's, Luke's, now confirmed speech problems. In light of the recently learned urgency about the matter, I have no choice but to write to you to please confirm to me that Luke is in fact in early intervention. My requests in this regard have gone unanswered to date.

While I don't have his legal custody, I am still his father and I simply cannot stand by and allow his now urgent speech problems to fall through the cracks. Nevertheless, I am hoping that my concerns are just that, only expected fatherly concerns and that he is being cared for.

Please note that both custody cases are headed to trials scheduled for August 2012. And since my serious reservations regarding the GAL investigations have not been addressed yet, the outcome of the trials is uncertain. Unfortunately, based on recently learned restrictions regarding effective speech therapy, Luke simply doesn't have the time to wait until the trials are over.

In order to put you at ease regarding my phone calls, I am attaching my motion questioning the validity of the GAL report. Also, while you had written a letter that Ms. Woburn used to attempt to get an RO against me in 2009, I must disclose to you the attached letter I sent to Ms. Rutland at the time that she used to request the two RO's against Ms. Woburn. Ms. Rutland is unfortunately using that letter as an evidence against me now.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

### Father "Attempting To Put You In The Middle"

Dear Dr. Goldsmith

As Alessia Woburn has informed you, Attorney Nicholas Iannuzzi and I represent Ms. Woburn in pending cases (cited above) with the Middlesex Probate and Family Court which concern custody of Luke and Lola Laker. I am writing to you in response to Andreas Laker's calls and recent letter to you regarding your patients, Luke and Lola Laker and his request that you provide him with medical information.

As Mr. Laker has noted, he has no legal custody of his children. Please find enclosed copies of the orders of the Honorable Dorothy M. Gibson of the Middlesex Probate and Family Court in this regard dated May 25, 2011 and August 25, 2011. I have also enclosed the judge's order of July 13, 2011, denying Mr. Laker's Motion for Joint Custody of Luke on which she noted "the parties cannot communicate or meaningfully work together". The attachments to Mr. Laker's letter to you certainly demonstrate that the observation in the July 13, 2011 order continues to be pertinent where he is appealing to you and attempting to put you in the middle which Ms. Woburn did not envision.

By definition, "sole legal custody" which Ms. Woburn has means that "one parent shall have the right and responsibility to make major decisions regarding the child's welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development." G.L. c. 208, p 31; G.L. c. 209C, p 1 (emphasis supplied).

I would ask that you not respond to Mr. Laker's request for these reasons. Please do not
hesitate to call with any questions you may have.

> Very truly yours,
> Mary R. LaCivita, Esq.

### Boy's Diagnosed PTSD vs. Stereotypical, Fabricated ADD/ADHD

Dear Dr. Goldsmith,

I am in receipt of your letter (see attached #1). I have noted with great relief that you had changed your mind and had decided to refer Leon to a psychiatrist, a medical doctor. Please recall that I requested from you just over two months ago to make this seemingly crucial step in helping my son. At that time your response to me was "Leon doesn't need another medical doctor, he is perfectly healthy".

I came to you with troubling concerns stemming from Leon's psychological evaluation, a copy of which I handed to you. Dr. Lawson, Leon's therapist, requested the testing that ended up reporting about Leon allegedly talking of suicide. In your letter you simply dismiss this fact with a remark that the testing "came back inconclusive". My reading of the report, however, clearly indicates that a) diagnosis of ADHD/ADD was categorically ruled out and b) Leon was firmly diagnosed instead with an Adjustment Disorder (see #2). Am I overlooking something as a layman?

I also noted with sadness you claiming that "both of his parents are not in agreement with ... medication trial". I must remind you that you and I closely worked together on successfully taking care of Leon's serious medical conditions and I never once complained nor questioned your use of the countless medications that Leon was prescribed to take every day for months on end. Moreover, I don't believe that you once contacted or talked to Leon's Mom, Abigail, during the four years of my custody of the children. Your statement about us thus seems dishonest to me.

You also seem to insinuate that I was given the questionnaires and I somehow intentionally declined to forward them to you. I have attached (see #3) all the communication I have had regarding them. As you can see I was not aware that you would be making your decision in such a seemingly rushed fashion. I still have the forms in case you would like to consider Leon's father's observations for your final, comprehensive and balanced diagnosis.

Leon's teacher had known him for only a month or so before she voiced her complaints exclusively to Abigail. Nevertheless, you seem to reduce my concerns regarding this to a simple disagreement of mine with "labeling Leon with this diagnosis". As such, I am not sure if you have read my letter to Mrs. Kelly and I am attaching it herein (see #4) for your convenience. Moreover, since you write "his mother would like to start medications", I feel that you are indicating undisclosed motives on Abigail's part that simply cannot be based on a medical doctor's diagnosis just yet.

Supporting this, I am noticing with shock that you refer to and base your medical reasoning on a "diagnosis" given by your colleague, Dr. Kurens. I need to disclose to you that after I had contacted Dr. Kurens back in 2011 (see #5), Dr. Kurens never had the decency to even return my call never mind to confirm **any** diagnosis of hers. I simply cannot take Dr. Kurens seriously when it comes to my son's care. I hope you agree with me on this.

I also notice with disbelief that you fail to mention Harriet Otis' publicly disseminated PTSD diagnosis for Leon (see #6B). While I suspect that Ms. Otis had not been briefed about Leon's medical past either, she also seemed to have subsequently overlooked Leon's newly developed and repeated sleepwalking incidents. During those 6 months the children abruptly lost all physical contact with their father, their sole former caretaker. I believe that Ms. Otis was your referee as well at the same time Dr. Kurens conferred with you. Is there a reason why this is irrelevant for you?

While I am cognizant that I have no training nor expertise in medicine, I have been informed that ADD/ADHD and PTSD symptoms can sometimes be confused, i.e. "there are a variety of mimics of ADHD that may be confused with ADHD, especially when a child has had the kind of physical trauma from urological surgery as Leon has had at a young age". Nevertheless, I seem to fail to find anything pointing to you mitigating any such risks of "confusion" in your letter, diagnosis or medical reasonings so far. Would such a confusion be harmless if medication was used?

I feel that I need to ask you to please clarify your stance on this seemingly crucial detail that was brought to my layman's attention in order to relieve my concerns regarding your intentions. I need to be explicit regarding this because I am still surprised at your knee-jerk response to me during our meeting when I reminded you of Leon's difficult bladder tests and surgery. At that time you quickly dismissed and abruptly stopped me with a "oh, he has long forgotten that". Since you didn't give me a chance during that short meeting to remind you of what Leon went through, I am supplying you once again with the condensed version of my account (see #7).

I am deeply concerned about this because I suspect that no other adult male, especially a father, would be comfortable with your seemingly insensitive dismissal on the account of a 4.5 yo boy in your care who was crying, screaming and wildly trashing from the pain and horror of the bloody catheterizations with no pain killers administered while being literally sat on by two nurses and with **only** his father watching on helplessly within his sights.

My concerns for your priorities when it comes to Leon's care are further amplified by the lack of reporting of other significant medical facts during the investigative phases of **both** ongoing trials. Since you are the only medical doctor to have seen or treated any of my four children, this fact seems systematic in nature to me. I would be happy to accept an explanation regarding this in order to dismiss these troubling fatherly concerns of mine.

This unfortunate perception of mine, namely the seemingly intentional isolation of the father on your part at the expense of all the involved children, however is also reenforced by you stating to me that "supervised visitations have not gone well because Leon personally complained to me about you whispering to him, something that scared him very much". You then quickly added that, based on Leon's account, you "cannot recommend lifting the supervised visits any time soon" and that **"your kids will be in therapy for the rest of their lives"**.

As my children's pediatrician and only medical doctor in their care so far, I feel that I can and should expect at least a seemingly objective and balanced opinion from you. You never gave me the chance to explain that 1) I have had over 220 supervised visits with my children without any reported concerns by the now two independent agencies (except for the highly debated "whispering" allegations as well as a strongly denied one-time missed diaper change allegation for Lola that caused a "bloody rash" that went completely undocumented, unreported and healed without any perceivable signs in just two days), 2) I have had over 640 nightly phone calls that have been meticulously recorded by Abigail without one single conversation brought to my or the court's attention so far for any wrongdoing on my part and 3) you have stated numerous times before that I was a "rational mind" when explaining the various options and choices regarding Leon's difficult medical conditions, surgery and extensive treatments. As such, I wanted to explain to you that I had fully understood that supervised visitations, while protecting my children, are also protecting me from the intimidation and the never ending wild allegations in the two lawsuits. Hence, I respected, cherished and valued this monitoring service consciously and rationally from day one and would never even think about violating any of their stated rules. The logical reason again was very simple: they protected me personally as much as they safeguarded my physical connection with all of my children under these truly out-of-control circumstances.

Moreover, on a personal level it struck me that a medical doctor so openly would question a father's sanity when you blatantly told me in my face that "I don't even know if you are rational". Being caught off-guard by your insultingly voiced doubts regarding my mental abilities, especially after years of us working together, I had no choice but to show you the extensive and complete psychiatric evaluation given to me by Dr. Bursztajn, a Harvard psychiatry professor. Dr. Harrison, a child psychiatrist specifically requested by the GALs in both lawsuits, also seemingly fully supported Dr. Bursztajn's opinion (see #8). You took the report on an "off the record" basis. My offering, of course, was a knee- jerk reaction, a self-defense reflex on my part to your seemingly calculated and well-honed tactic for intimidation.

I then tried to ask you if putting easily verifiable false statements (see #6A) in writing was rational. You had been keenly aware of the actual documented truth (see #9) that seemingly was not revealed during the investigations. There have been 16 psychologists and psychiatrists involved in the case so far. I personally volunteered and sought long- term help for myself from 5. Wouldn't one be suspicious of accusations like "counseling is for the weak" when in fact there is only one person, the accuser, who has not been evaluated or in therapy at all? Surprisingly, I must be on Abigail's side in this however (see below). And yes, putting easily verifiable false statements in writing is perfectly rational for some and is a guaranteed money maker for ruthless attorneys (see #10). Our combined legal expenses are fast approaching a million dollars in the two never ending trials, with no continuation dates set for either at this time!

Most importantly, I was cut short of explaining my concerns to you about Leon's prompt reporting of his "dad whispered to me" fears that you hastily accused me of. He came in to see you for canker sores, yet he immediately volunteered to report about his fears, which of course I have no issues with whatsoever. What is concerning to me is you failing to notice that the "whispering incident" allegedly happened almost a year before and, unless one subscribes to the rabid allegations filed with the court in both lawsuits accusing the supervised visitation centers with "endangering the children's safety" and that "they have been drinking father's cool-aid", one would argue that those stated fears by my little boy are somewhat irrational in nature. Especially considering your stance that Leon's actual horrible, unmitigated pain and suffering documented by hospital records should be "long forgotten" by him.

However, Leon has been in therapy all this time with Dr. Lawson. Your report of his still ongoing, decidedly irrational fears thus seem to be an eloquent proof that Dr. Lawson's long-winded therapy hasn't been as effective as possible. Dr. Lawson was nice to see me in January regarding my concerns about her therapy. She had known about my claims that the trial investigation was biased, incomplete and flawed and she received my 100+ page affidavit supporting those claims that I personally filed with the court. She was also briefed that even my relationship with my own mother was falsified in the process (see #11) and that Dr. Harrison's specialist diagnosis was withheld at the trial (see #12).

During the meeting I also told Dr. Lawson that Abigail's attorneys Otis and Lenihan: 1) have been filing numerous verifiably false statements with the court (e.g. see #13), 2) they flat out lied to the judge during hearings (i.e. I was not arrested, I was not under criminal investigation, DCF didn't recommend one hour per month visits, etc.), 3) during my deposition they both tried to force me to accept a falsified, by them, email between myself and my attorney as evidence, thus blatantly attempting to pierce my attorney/client privilege and 4) they openly yelled at me and repeatedly threatened me with immediately calling the judge if I didn't say under oath what they were set out to hear (I stood my ground as a concerned father because the yelling and threats were all about Leon's alleged suicide talk).

I also told Dr. Lawson that during my therapy sessions, Dr. Harrison repeatedly noted to me that "they are very, very dangerous borderlines" and she also warned me "you have no idea what they are capable of". I clearly understood that Dr. Harrison couldn't diagnose the moms of my children since she had never seen them. However, I also understood that Dr. Harrison was a trained expert in recognizing those troubling patterns from the court filed motions and reports. Those motions, and the reflected behavior patterns quickly recognized by the doctor, were the works of emotionally detached, rational professionals with seeming no restraint for lying, cheating and flat out bullying for a reward.

I didn't tell Dr. Lawson at the time that Attorney Monroe Inker (who allegedly "rewrote" the divorce law) briefed me about his win-win strategy back when Abigail and I were their trusted, newly minted multi-millionaire "team" against Abigail's "job-hopping" first ex. Prudent attorneys like Inker and Otis, who worked under Inker for Abigail at the time, seemingly completely missed the signs of the now alleged "bully" in me, who would soon thereafter allegedly "bully" Abigail into leaving her little children behind, while we were all "fighting" the other bully, Ryan's father.

I also told her that the visitation center handed me a written list of "house rules" that they had wanted me to enforce after seeing how Leon was getting away with disregarding my words while Lisa didn't disregard me. This was during a visit when Leon was feeling sick and in pain from his now diagnosed canker sores. I tried to explain to Dr. Lawson that with all the wildly false allegations in this case, I couldn't just tell the children the rules. I could only feel safe and protected from Abigail's attorneys if I wrote the rules down (see #14). Dr. Lawson clearly didn't agree with me and we exchanged the attached letters (see #15). Needless to say, the leading rule that the visitation monitors emphasized to me was the one that Dr. Lawson picked on and isolated in her response letter to me and to Abigail.

Since I can only view Dr. Lawson's highly polarizing response to my concerns, that she promptly handed directly to Abigail as a seeming further attempt to "create" facts for the lawsuit, along the lines of Inker's win-win strategy and similar to the "whispering" fabrications, I have no choice but to question Dr. Lawson's priorities when it comes to treating Leon. As far as my daughter Lisa is concerned, Dr. Lawson seems to quickly loose interest and is without any regard to the fact that I only see the children together and what she suggests in her letter is simply not feasible due to the twin-dynamic. Hence, I asked Abigail to consider a different, Massachusetts-based therapist for Leon's best interests. I hereby ask you to also please consider referring Leon to a possibly more effective and balanced therapist.

Dr. Gallagher, Lisa's therapist, on the other hand I find very caring, skillful, thoughtful, responsive and highly professional. I feel that Lisa is in excellent hands with her, truly benefitting from the long-term therapy in these trying times for a developing child (see #16).

Despite the protracted trials and the extreme personal hardship, decidedly alleviated however by the beneficial effect of my long-term therapies, I can't hold the mothers of my children accountable for the wildly false allegations brought up against me. And I have been ready to settle for over a year now. However, how can anyone walk away from all those documented lies? All of us are emotional and when Abigail is still most concerned about and demands that "he shall immediately notify Mother in writing if he "reconciles and engages in a romantic and/or sexual relationship with Alessia Woburn", then it is clear that settling this three-way "perfect storm" (for the plaintiff's attorneys) is simply out of question. I need to note that I first met the Mom of my youngest 2 children 6 months after Abigail left our house without even kissing the 3.5 yo twins good-bye. Also, reconciling with either mother is simply unimaginable for me!

Nevertheless, Attorney Lacivita in the Alessia case has followed the Inker win-win strategy even more so than the other two attorneys. She has flat out lied to the judge about her own written communication with my attorney, she has ended the hearings with a "remember judge, this man threw his fetus across the room" and she has used the verifiably false allegations from the Abigail case a lot more effectively than even Abigail's attorneys. In the meantime, since Alessia ran out of the $250K that I had given her for the children, Lacivita has racked up a sudden $50K debt from a mother who allegedly has no job and no savings. As per the strategy, I haven't had a chance to say anything so far in the 2 year old lawsuit. And even Alessia's uncrossed testimony doesn't mention "throwing fetuses across the room". By the time light is shed on these wild allegations, Lacivita will have amassed a fortune with obviously no trace.

There is no restraint, there are no limits and it is a free-for-all. How could Alessia settle the case in her right mind with a "fetus throwing monster" now? Of course, it seems to be besides the point that our personal tragedy, the miscarriage, happened before our two children were born, before Alessia accepted an engagement proposal from me, before she moved in with me and before she signed a marriage license with me. But the attorney, with her keen sense to exploit other people's deepest tragedy for her own financial gain, has no qualms about locking us in a status quo, with visitation expenses the same as child support and the money all gone. And the fact that I have long completed what the court had asked of me and there have not been any complaints about my visits so far simply doesn't matter.

There have been continuous attempts at sanctioning me for sharing info between the two cases. It seems that I must split my person into two strictly separate entities and literally become a "split personality". And that I should always deny even having children in the "other" case, similar to a "Sophie's choice" scenario. In the meantime Abigail and Alessia are freely sharing DCF and GAL reports, exchange thousands of messages, their three attorneys are even building up a debt (payable by father) by billing for their unconstrained chatting with each other and they even hire "spies" to listen in on the court hearings and trials. But for them my left brain cannot communicate with the right.

In closing, and most importantly, **I would like to ask you to consider referring Leon to a local, Massachusetts-based specialist psychiatrist** (see #17). I feel that we owe Leon accountability in front of the courts while choosing an additional medical doctor for him. I fail to see a reason why after all this we should leave the state of Massachusetts in order to find proper care for my son. Moreover, the parents suddenly find themselves in a dire state financially, relying solely on insurance for medical care. And the fact that Dr. Lawson last complained just over a month ago about insurance not paying for her out-of-state services, an out-of-state medical doctor would leave Leon with an even more uncertain and unstable medical care. Sooner or later the insurance company will start to ask questions as well and I will have no choice but to brief them about these matters.

Sincerely,

### "Cancer For Boy Is A Real Possibility"

Atty. Harris and Dr. Bursztajn,

I have talked to the oncologist at Mass General yesterday. What she said sounded more bleak and scary than anything before. I haven't slept much last night and I feel that it is time for me to send the attached letter and attachments to Dr. Goldsmith. I also would like to ask you to possibly submit the letter to the judge as well to facilitate his pending order. If that is not possible, could we ask for a replacement pediatrician from the judge on an emergency basis? Dr. Wargo seemed very serious about Leon receiving proper care quickly. Please review the letter and let me know, I know that this is also a trap from Abigail. They only want to win the lawsuit and I cannot even see my son!

---

Dear Dr. Goldsmith,

I have spoken with Dr. Wargo regarding Leon's "abnormal" biopsy results. In cooperation with Dr. Flaherty, another Mass General oncologist, she had concluded that **cancer for my little boy is a real possibility** and suggested to enlarge and surgically remove a large area around where his mole used to be. She also requested testing his lymph nodes for a possible metastasis. She expressed urgency, I agreed and she was kind to schedule the intervention for the 22nd.

Needless to say, I expressed to Dr. Wargo my strong concern for the sustained emotional stress and extreme hardship my children have been and continue to be exposed to without any sign of relief and professional help. I briefed her shortly about Leon's medical history and explained to her that I had asked the children's pediatrician multiple times to refer him to a specialist psychiatrist. I also explained that due to the protracted, jealousy-based, million dollar plus three-way lawsuits the children's therapists suddenly quit months ago and there have not been any replacements so far. I also expressed my concerns over Leon's suddenly increased number of visits to the doctor with various infections and long-term canker sores and the seeming weekly colds and overall "not feeling good"s.

Dr Wargo was appalled hearing that as the result of my concerns, the pediatrician and the therapists relayed to Abigail that they would continue caring for the children only if the court carried out the "complete isolation of father from the children", as Abigail testified in person directly to the judge in April.

Furthermore, hearing that as per Atty. Lenihan's statement to the judge, the pediatrician openly questioned father's sanity and rationality due to his complaining (despite an extensive psychiatry evaluation in her hands contradicting that), Dr. Wargo summarized that emotional stress and hardship, frequent infections and overall physical sickness are all interconnected.

Dr. Wargo subsequently concluded that **"this should be a wake-up call for the pediatrician and everyone else to start taking the children's wellbeing seriously"** and to provide proper care. She then expressed her hope that Leon will be found cancer-free soon.

Since my letters to you have gone unanswered and I have been completely shut out of any discussions or updates to my children's medical wellbeing, I need to report that after my complaints to you, the children have suddenly become "afraid" to visit with their father. I am attaching a copy of the summary report regarding the refused supervised visits. The children sometimes gave no reason and other times seemingly struggled to answer the monitors.

Just before a scheduled court hearing, where I was asking the judge to order a family therapist to look into the children's reported fears, Leon finally gave a condition for continuing the visits: he wanted my apologies. Knowing what "bothered" him at last, I immediately assured Leon and everyone else involved that I have never been afraid of apologizing and I will be happy to repeat my apologies to him or to anyone else as many times as necessary. 

During the hearing however, Atty. Lenihan claimed that the children are "not ready" and essentially declined the possibility of **any** therapist's involvement regarding the children. And now that the hearing is over, the children are back to living in fear of seeing their father again. Just after the hearing I had one very happy, relaxed and relieved visit with the children where they both expressed their "I love you daddy", a first since the daily such expressions before February. With the threat of the hearing gone, however, it will be three weeks again that I had not been able to visit with the children or see them. I am very concerned about their often expressed vague fears.

Regarding "hitting Leon", I have never denied slapping him on the back of his head on two occasions, once each as an ill conceived attempt of mine at disciplining him. I also immediately and repeatedly apologized to him and to everyone else and the incidents are thoroughly documented. I was open about this serious mistake of mine to everyone including the children, Abigail, Alessia, the police, DCF, GALs, therapists, doctors, judges, etc. And I had no issue following all the requests and recommendations in order to change and to avoid any of this from happening in the future. I feel that through long-term therapy I have learned a great amount of skills of coping even with extremely stressful and debilitating situations such as the current protracted and impossibly destructive dual lawsuits.

Nevertheless, the original "beating" allegations, that quickly mushroomed into "daily child beatings", and were so successfully used to jump-start the two lawsuits are simply not true. As I openly turned down Abigail's request to join my company just two weeks before all started and listened to her "that whore will not get OUR money", referring to Alessia, I have well founded reasons to believe that these lawsuits are jealousy and money related. Unfortunately, I have no protection that the system provides me with against Abigail's lawyer's open lies to the court, their documented falsifying of documents, their open bullying and threats as well as their delaying tactics to keep the lawsuits churning to their benefit. In the meantime the innocent children are seriously suffering in plain view to all.

The attorneys signed court documents alleging that, among others, "in refusing to agree to counseling for the children, the Defendant expressed his belief that mental health counseling is for the "weak"", despite them (and everyone else involved) knowing that in fact the exact opposite had happened is an obvious and by now well documented instance at how the wellbeing of the children is disregarded by so many professionals in the case. Thus far Abigail hasn't even acknowledged any of those documented facts, never mind apologize for them and to start the process of correcting them. I simply cannot apologize for her actions, no matter how much the system pressures me to do so.

Regardless of whom you believe, the facts are that Leon has serious medical conditions and increasing occurrences of various infections, the children are reportedly confused and they live in now well documented fear, they continue to be denied the most basic mental and emotional healthcare available to all and this three-way lawsuit in its third year has no end in sight as the court hasn't even communicated any continuation dates.

As such, I am asking you once again to please refer Leon to a specialist psychiatrist who practices in Massachusetts (your previous referral to such a doctor in Manchester, NH is clearly not in the best interest of the child). I am also requesting you to please refer both children to individual therapists specializing in emotional abuse and parental alienation treatments. 

Sincerely,

```python
"Thank you for updating me Andreas. I wonder if it may help to offer the name of a child psychiatrist, as well as a pediatric dermatologist and a new pediatrician to consider? I am currently in Amsterdam for a conference but will be returning this coming Wednesday."

## Dear Child Therapist

I am in receipt of your letter and I am writing to respond. I appreciate that you have taken the time to explain your perception of my response to Ms. Senechal's email regarding Leon's intake, but please understand that was not my intent. I thought that my email was clear when viewed in the context of the "Intake/Assessment appointment" form that I was responding to.

The form was not sent to me in order to allow you to continue seeing Leon, it was sent to obtain my consent to Leon seeing a new practitioner at The Counseling Center, and that is what I was responding to. The standard form gave me 4 distinct choices, each using the word, "treatment". I would never consent to "treatment" for my son by **an unnamed and undisclosed doctor when I do not know what the so-called treatment is to be**, so I marked the only choice possible to me on your form letter.

Moreover, I find it unfortunate that The Counseling Center of Nashua, NH seemingly made the decision to abruptly end my son's and daughter's treatment based upon this response to a form email, without ever attempting to clarify the intent of my response to a new intake/assessment request. Had you called me or written to me about this, I would have clearly explained to you that under no circumstances would I want to end Leon's or Lisa's ongoing treatment so abruptly without ensuring their safety by transitioning to a new provider for continuing treatment.

Additionally, I do not understand why Leon is being given a referral to someone else in your office for a "meds assessment." Can you please explain to me why Leon is going in for a "meds assessment" and what diagnosis the medications are for? I am not aware of any clinical diagnosis that has been provided to Leon that would require medication so I am a bit confused as to what the medication assessment is about. If it is for ADHD, which is what I understand from Abigail, I don't understand where this is coming from.

Leon was evaluated just last May by one of your colleagues and the report clearly stated that "Leon does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder." It also clearly stated that "Leon may benefit from repeated testing to evaluate cognitive ability, ADHD, and mood in 2-3 years". My understanding is that first you are diagnosed with a condition and then you discuss treatment options, including medication, with the diagnosing physician. If my understanding of the process is inaccurate, please let me know.

As for Leon's ongoing therapy, you have indicated that I have never informed you of my concerns regarding Leon's treatment but that simply isn't the case. I have expressed to you my concerns that after all this time, according to you, Leon has not improved. I believe that if he is not getting better, we need to look at the current treatment and see what can be done differently to improve things for him and our entire family.

It is my understanding from Abigail that you do not wish to be involved in Leon's care if I have shared legal custody of Leon. Is that the case? I don't think that Leon's treatment relationship with you should be contingent on what is going on in our court case, but rather it should be based on Leon's needs. It does not appear that there is an immediate end in sight for our court case as we do not have a final trial date, but Leon still needs treatment. What are your plans regarding his therapy? Are you going to resume his therapy or give us recommendations for a new treatment provider?

I understand that you provided a name for someone to see him for Abigail's concerns regarding ADHD but what about his ongoing therapy? If you are not going to continue seeing him, do you have any suggestions for a local provider that could take over his care? Now that Abigail and I are both in Massachusetts, it seems to make sense that we transition to someone local if you are not continuing on with his care.

I look forward to your response so that we can work together to get Leon the help that he needs.

Sincerely,

### "I don't believe therapist is effective"

Dear Abigail,

Has Dr. Goldsmith decided on the actual psychiatrist in NH? Would you be willing to agree on a more local psychiatrist (there is no need to go across the border for a doctor, especially in Massachusetts)? How about local therapists? Yes, I don't believe that Dr. Lawson is effective with Leon at all. I feel however that Lisa is in really good hands with Dr. Gallagher.

Thanks,

```python
"Andreas, Dr. Goldsmith recommended using a psychiatrist who works directly with Dr Lawson.  I am following her recommendation and have spoken with Dr. Lawson regarding Dr. Goldsmith's recommendation.  I am currently awaiting Dr. Lawson's response."

"Dr. Goldsmith previously recommended Dr. Kurens, but you objected to her as well."
```

I tried to contact Dr. Kurens back in 2011 and she never returned my call, never mind confirming any diagnosis (see attached). You cannot take Dr. Kurens seriously, can you?

If you are interested we can go back to Dr. Goldsmith together to ask for a referral to a local psychiatrist. If not then I will have no choice but to voice my concerns to Dr. Goldsmith about choosing someone who is so closely related to Dr. Lawson **(out of state and not even having a name!)**.

Leon has been in therapy with Dr. Lawson for over a year now with seemingly no improvements, Dr. Lawson has clearly misdiagnosed Leon and she also seems to have other ["toxic masculinity"] priorities than to normalize Leon's relationship with his parents.

Besides, I strongly believe that Dr. Lawson's letter doesn't serve Leon's best interests. I have lost confidence in Dr. Lawson's ability to successfully treat our son. I hope you can understand my position.

Of course, I wish to avoid going into a discussion over this. I am only seeking a way to collaboratively solve this problem. In this regard, it would help if you could answer my previous questions.

## Supervised "Waterboarding" Of Children

Dear Visitation Coordinator

I am writing to notify you with sadness that I feel I have no choice left but to end supervised visitations with my children. I am making my decisions under extreme duress caused by serious concerns for my children's wellbeing. My court testimonies and depositions also abundantly reflect the same.

As my current affidavit in this regard details, the plaintiffs' attorneys have relentlessly filed misrepresenting and misleading statements in their 70+ motions over the 2.5 years of the dual lawsuits, they have resorted to "doctoring" emails and email chains, to openly threatening and bullying me into changing my statements, they seemingly encouraged dissemination of privileged documents, themselves openly disseminated parts of a severely damaging court impounded document with yet unproven validity. They have also forcibly kept us in the prolonged trials, encouraged restricting the children from contact with their grandparents and supported the withholding of school and the children's medical related information from father. And the list goes on. And there is nothing I could do about it with irreversible decisions having been made in the meantime. And the combined legal bill seems to be well above the million dollar mark without any signs of relenting in the attorneys' appetite.

As I have not been able to have a full 2 hour visit with Lisa & Leon since last April, I feel that they themselves have been chronically exposed to the extreme and concerted warfare the mothers and their attorneys have waged against their children's father. Continuing the visitations would only expose the children to even more indirect humiliation, confusion, pain and suffering.

While the visits with the 4 and 2 year old Luke and Lola have gone quite differently, I have no choice but to cancel those visits as well to avoid falling into a "Sophie's choice" trap. **All four of my children are equally dear to me despite the concerted efforts at splitting me and the deeply interconnected lawsuits into two isolated "independent" sides.**

In closing I wanted to thank you for your and your staff's caring and gentle yet profound professionalism. I can only praise you and your services and I feel that I am forever indebted to Alternative House and MSPCC for allowing me to have physical contact with all of my children and making the now about 300 supervised visits possible. Without such wonderful institutions as yours, the two mothers' cruel quest to "**completely isolate father from children**" (as was actually demanded by the attorneys in court) would have been immediately successful.

Sincerely,

### Ms. Julia Brice, FairPlay

Hi Julia,

Any word about the visit tomorrow? The phone calls are back to normal (thank you Abigail)... chance for a yet another nice, happy and calming visit?

Thanks so much in advance,

PS. Perhaps no seemingly dirty tricks and using children 'as forced and unaware witnesses' for 'higher causes'? Deutsch's stereotypical trick to 'obfuscate and delegate' when pushed to the limit, that she used as a pattern with both Olezeski and Kivisto in a much documented fashion, will not work...

```python
"Hi Andreas Hi Abigail, The children wish to go to Barnes and Nobel in Nashua where we have had visits before and dinner. Please confirm the time. I will meet Andreas, Dad, inside 15 minutes before the visit. Best"
```

Hi Julia,

Has anything changed from last time that I should know about? Have you personally witnessed anything that should change your firm stance from two weeks ago (see below)?

Please confirm that you intend to force this visit on father and his children as seemingly nothing has transpired in the last two weeks that should lead me to reconsider or change my protective stance towards my children and their mother.

Obviously, I am confirming the visit, as I never say 'no' to seeing my children. But it will be a coerced, forced - against the parties' demonstrated free will - state sponsored and court mandated supervised visit! Nevertheless and of course, the children and we will have the best time of our lives tomorrow, independent of the venue...

Thanks in advance,

PS. If you ignore my email, as you confirmed in person to me that you don't 'read emails', I will take a 'no response' as a 'gun to my head' forced 'otherwise your children will not see their father again' threatening step. In that case see you then and there, otherwise happily see you wherever. The choice is entirely yours...

```python
"You clearly shared in front of the children. And the other supervisor u had no problem going here: that you have had good visits here... Monday you can go to the library. I not the parent coordinator. C you tomorrow at Barnes n Noble 3:15 for exchange, Stevee exchange protocols for 3;30 visit. Best Julia"
```

Hi Julia,

That's a negative! And Jean, you and I discussed the previous visits... Please, let's not start rewriting history! It will get very messy very quickly...

I was very disappointed the last time we talked and you started doing just that. You remember, you suddenly claimed that the children "didn't even want to get out of the car the very, very first visit", almost exactly 2 years ago. And that you had to beg them.... I wasn't there but I have a direct email from whom else but the nastiest evil doer, Otis herself, confirming the undisputed success of that very first visit...

Just in case if you are inclined to "settle", "make a deal" or just "mutually compromise" and circumvent the escalating situation in favor of the children you are assigned to protect, I offer you a possible solution for tomorrow.

Let's have a visit tomorrow in a peaceful, calm setting (your choice). Please invite Jean as well so that we don't fall into the "weird, dirty trick" situation where one is not there to be an actual eye witness to a possible crime against children but shows up seconds later to still be a "FairPlay LLC witness" for family court purposes. Additionally we will need Jean as an additional material witness to protect the children and ourselves! And I will be very happy to pay for Jean's time!

And let us chat about books, reading, book stores etc. with the children without forcefully "waterboarding" them for the "right" (i.e. canned) answers. I love books and I read all the time. I would be the happiest to hear that Leon has interest in books after all (which he certainly does, but he is not allowed to say it and he thus can't confirm it).

But perhaps it will come from him after all in a calm, nice, friendly, safe, comforting, child friendly, and by the books "supervised visitation" setting... And then we go to the bookstore of their choice the following week... only a week later!... and without you putting your six shooter against my temple...

**And we put this fiasco behind us with pride and certain victory over the Inker/Otis/Deutsch doctrine :-)**

PS. Are you really that much of a "feminist"? It was sad to hear you telling an 11 old about that, several times... right in front of her dad. As a supervised visitation monitor...

### Supervised Visits Cancelled Indefinitely

Hi Julia,
  
Regarding your "You clearly shared in front of the children" and "And the other supervisor u had no problem going here : that you have had good visits here...".

FYI, please see the forwarded email below regarding that specific visit with Jean....

And we went to Barnes & Noble... and the very first thing Leon asked for is to go over to Not Your Average Joe's to eat.

Of course we had a great time during the visit! We always do. I am their dad and I love my children. Anywhere we go we have a great time! Always! We would have a good time together even in hell, so to speak...

And yes, we went back to the bookstore for about 20 minutes because I also have a daughter! And she had a list of books to buy. But Leon wasn't interested in anything, he couldn't be... he finally bought a Homer Simpson comic book... if you can call that a "book".

So, Julia, I have to say that I am not impressed... things are certainly not all kosher... you seem to be actively fragmenting written realities, and doing it in writing.

And I specifically didn't like when Jean intentionally and forcefully put my children on the spot and confronted them against their will in front of their dad with an "innocent" question two weeks ago while you were not there. But she then quickly reported their canned answers to you when you showed up a few minutes later (mysteriously, for the very last 5 minutes of the 2 hour visit). And Jean did that without even mentioning what really happened and how the children really reacted!

They are my children and I don't like it when you are playing dirty games at their expenses! And at their mother's expense!

Will you be going forward with your forced and threatening visit tomorrow? Please confirm.... you seem to be invalidating written realities and it is not right. It is about innocent children!

---

Hi Abigail,

I believe that we have arrived to a point where we need to move on. After brainstorming about these alarming developments, where the written reality is so casually turned upside down and where "professional" adults intentionally put children on the spot and forcefully confront them in front of their parents, just to prove some point, I have come to the conclusion that I need to protect my children, their mothers and myself personally.

**I simply cannot expose my family to the high risks and danger of continuing with supervised visitations when the monitors seem to be so easily compromised and turned against the children they were asked to protect.**

As I intend to request/reopen investigations at the 4 police departments, at the DA's office in Boston and the FBI for various criminal and child abuse activities spanning across the state borders, I simply cannot risk the children being harmed every week for the foreseeable future. Please take care of the children... I love them and I will miss seeing them tremendously. I still can't watch them being tortured and forcefully interrogated, "waterboarded" by adults assigned to protect them. I hope this storm will be quick and there will be peace on the other side.

### "Stop the emails or your children will be tortured"

```python
"Mr. Laker, It is my understanding that your visits started yesterday, and that it went well. I can assure you that Ms. Rutland has supported the visits, and that we did not try to prevent the visits from starting. My comments on the documents provided by Ms. Brice were relative to Ms. Rutland's obligations only. I ask that you not send out any more emails as I feel they are disruptive to the visitation process. Thank you."
```

Hi Alessia, (and Abigail too)

I would like to ask you to please allow the children to call their dad once or twice weekly (three times would be ideal :-). I have short conversations with my twins on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at around 8 pm.

**Seeing my always happy little Luke so upset last Friday**, as he arrived to the supervised visit at Alternative House almost on the verge of crying, broke my heart. He sat there right next to me, quietly watching a movie for most of the visit while calming down in my caressing hug. By the end of the visit he almost returned to his old himself... almost. The sadness in his innocent soul wasn't gone anymore though. It seems to me that Otis' ruthless threat of "stop the emails or your children will be tortured" is as real as ever.

Deutsch and Otis have met their match in this "But your Honor, he is a Romanian immigrant!" (I still can hear the disgust in Otis' often repeated voice in the court room and see the emphasized "important flag" on Deutsch's handwritten notes). I am their match because **I do not compromise myself and will not torture nor personally allow the torturing of my children**, as Otis and Deutsch are seemingly so used to from other hapless fathers and mothers! Even if that means not seeing my children again... for a few months!

But now the 5 year long ruthless quest to drive the children's father away and completely sever the father-children bond is finally complete, despite the weekly supervised visits with no issues whatsoever for all these long torturous years. The children have completely lost all connection with their father, the connection with their extended family on their father's side and the never existing connection to their half sisters/half brothers (they live 5 miles apart!).

This is not your "garden variety" parental alienation anymore, that can be debated, argued and motioned about ad infinitum with one professional or ten or twenty chiming in on a whim and destroying the lives of children and their parents while making a comfortable living and perhaps basking in the "Deutsch" fame.

**This is outright, total and complete ejection of a father and any traces of him from his children's life, memory and reality!**

Thanks,

PS. Of course, I would be happy to call them too Alessia. But then you would not be able to record the conversations as per Abigail's 5 year long meaningless strict and rigid routine. I have absolutely no issues with my every conversation with my children being recorded or monitored. I am not the child abuser and/or the predator. It is just that extra touch of the extreme emotional abuse and mental torturing that the Inker/Otis/Deutsch doctrine mandates and is all about!
