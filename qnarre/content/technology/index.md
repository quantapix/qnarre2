Google's open-sourced TensorFlow, a top project on the "~36 million developers" GitHub, is arguably one of the most successful applications of the mathematics we understand and have come to personally love.

  The runnable examples currently depend on the "nightly" builds of TensorFlow 2.0 (downloadable with `!pip install -U tf-nightly` from running Jupyter notebooks).
