Encapsulation: objects contain both the data and the methods that affect that data

Abstraction: is a complementary concept to encapsulation; where encapsulation hides internal information, abstraction provides an easier-to-use public interface to data

Inheritance: objects can inherit variables and methods to support operations without having to provide own definition. The goal is to not repeat yourselfâ€”multiple uses of the same code is hard to maintain

Composition: with no inheritance, objects and methods quickly dissolve as the syntactic sugar for structs and procedures

Polymorphism: shape-changing allows one object or method to serve as the template for other objects and methods
